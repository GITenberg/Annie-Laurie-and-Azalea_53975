11</span>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TWO AND ONE MAKE&mdash;HOW
MANY?</span></h2>
<p>The long red clay road, winding down from the cabin where the
McBirneys lived on their high shelf of Tennyson mountain, was
frosted delicately with white, and by the roadside the curious
frost flowers lifted their heads, as airy-fine as fern.&nbsp;
From the half-hidden cabins all around the semicircle of
mountains that skirted the valley of Lee, shafts of smoke arose,
showing that the people were about the business of the day.&nbsp;
Straight, gray and shadowy these smoke-shafts lifted through the
lilac-tinted air; and below in the little town, other shafts of
smoke ascended as if in friendly answer.</p>
<p>Azalea McBirney, in her dark riding skirt and bright knitted
cap and reefer, came running from the cabin with the manner of a
girl very much behindhand.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he there yet, Zalie?&rdquo; a voice
called from the cabin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t Jim brought them
ponies around yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; Azalea answered over her shoulder,
starting toward the stable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe the ponies have
been naughty again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just stay where you be,&rdquo; commanded James
Stuart McBirney from the stable.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
all your work done, ben&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s all
you have to think about.&nbsp; This here is my job and I mean to
do it whatever comes, though these here ponies certainly do act
up on a morning like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>would</i> just as soon get my breath for a
moment,&rdquo; Azalea remarked to nobody in particular, seating
herself on the bench by the side of the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;As Hi
Kitchell&rsquo;s mother says, &lsquo;I bin goin&rsquo; like a
streak o&rsquo; lightnin&rsquo; since sunup.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her cheeks were, indeed, a trifle over-flushed, and forgetting
for a moment how time was hastening along, and that she and Jim
ought already to be on the road to school, she leaned her head
against the side of the cabin and looked about her
contentedly.&nbsp; She loved the scene before her; <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>loved the
pines with their light coating of hoarfrost; loved the waterfall
with its gleaming icicles; loved the scent of the wood-smoke and
the sight of &ldquo;Molly Cottontail&rdquo; scampering through
the bushes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the kiss of Mary McBirney lay warm on her
lips&mdash;Mary McBirney who had taken her in when she was a
motherless and friendless girl, and whom she found it sweet to
call mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; was a longer word than
Jim&mdash;otherwise James Stuart McBirney, the true son of the
house&mdash;found it convenient to use when he spoke of the woman
who was the background of his world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; was
the term he chose, and Mary McBirney would not have cared to have
him try any other.</p>
<p>For Jim was just Jim&mdash;her own freckled, shy, plucky
fellow.&nbsp; He went down to the district school, riding on the
pony the Carsons had given him, while beside him, quite as if she
were his own sister, rode Azalea, who trusted him to see her
through any danger of the road, who laughed as much as anybody
could wish at his &ldquo;hill billy&rdquo; jokes, and who never,
never forgot how he had welcomed her into his home, to share all
he had, <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>though there never had, at any time, been very much to
share.</p>
<p>Yet, though she had been only the &ldquo;child wonder&rdquo;
of a wandering &ldquo;show&rdquo; when she came to the
McBirney&rsquo;s&mdash;her own poor little mother lying dead in
one of the wagons&mdash;it was she, and not Jim, the carefully
reared boy, who had the grand little ways.&nbsp; Jim was a
country boy, with a country boy&rsquo;s straightforward, simple
manners.&nbsp; But about Azalea there was something&mdash;well,
something different.&nbsp; So different was she from the
McBirneys that she seemed like a cardinal bird which had been
storm-driven into one of the martin gourds that hung in the high
cross-trees before the McBirney&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>All that was easily understood by the few who knew her
story.&nbsp; Her grandfather had been Colonel Atherton, the
richest, the proudest, and the most elegant gentleman in all the
countryside.&nbsp; He had owned great plantations in the old
slave days, and had built the beautiful manor house which their
new, wonderfully kind neighbors, the Carsons, recently had
bought.&nbsp; Azalea&rsquo;s mother had exiled herself by a
marriage with a man of whom no parent could approve, and as
misfortune drove her ever lower and lower, she <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>came at
length to be a performer in the miserable roadside show with
which she had come, in her last hour, to the scene of her
father&rsquo;s old home.&nbsp; That home had long since passed
into other hands, and concerning it Azalea&rsquo;s mother had
told her daughter nothing.&nbsp; It had been by an accident that
she later learned the truth.</p>
<p>When Mr. and Mrs. Carson, the friends who had from the first
of their acquaintance with her endeavored to add to her
happiness, learned her story, they asked her to come into their
home to be a sister to their own girl, Carin.&nbsp; And Azalea in
her secret heart had longed to go&mdash;more than she ever would
have told, she longed to be with these accomplished and gracious
friends, whose wealth made it possible for them to do almost
anything they pleased, and who seemed pleased to do only
interesting things.&nbsp; But when she remembered the welcome
that had been given her by Mary McBirney, and indeed, by all of
the McBirney family, and how she had, in a way, taken the place
of their little dead Molly, she was able to put temptation from
her; and the hour in which she had made her choice and been
gathered in &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; McBirney&rsquo;s arms was the
happiest she ever had known.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>So,
though she was born Azalea Knox, the granddaughter of Colonel
Atherton, she was now known as Azalea McBirney, the waif the
McBirneys had taken into their cabin to grow up side by side with
their son James Stuart.&nbsp; And all over the Valley of Lee an
interest was felt in her; partly because of her being an orphan,
and a child of quaint and lovable ways, and partly because of a
strange happening.&nbsp; Not long after she had come to live with
the good mountain folk, the owner of the show with which she had
once traveled had kidnapped her, and the search for her had been
long and anxious.</p>
<p>When she was rescued and brought back to the home where she
was so welcomed and loved, all of the neighbors had a protective
feeling for her, and rejoiced that the Carsons, who had come down
from the North, and who seemed so eager to be of help to
everybody, should have taken her in to be taught with their
daughter.&nbsp; Never had there been such neighbors as the
Carsons in Lee.&nbsp; They made goodness their business, it
seemed.&nbsp; Through them the mountain folk were finding a
market for their homemade wares&mdash;their woven cloth and their
counterpanes, their baskets and chairs, and comfort had come into
many <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>a
home where hitherto there had been cruel poverty.</p>
<p>But there on the bench by the doorway in the nipping morning
air sits Azalea, with her nose and ears growing redder and
redder!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she called, awakening from her reverie,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be late as sure as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming right along now, sis,&rdquo; answered the boy as
he came running from the stable with the two ponies.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hop into the saddle, Zalie, and we&rsquo;ll just pelt it
down the mountain.&nbsp; Here, I&rsquo;ll hold him.&nbsp; There
you are.&nbsp; Hi&mdash;they&rsquo;re off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They surely were.&nbsp; Pa McBirney, busy in his little
smithy, heard the clatter of hoofs and thrust his head from the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out, you two!&rdquo; he warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; they called in chorus as they dashed
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sakes,&rdquo; said pa, coming in from the shop and
wiping his hands on his leathern apron, &ldquo;I trust to luck ma
didn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em going off.&nbsp; Them young uns are
getting too much spirit in &rsquo;em to suit me; and as for the
ponies, I think they ought to be cut down on their
feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But neither Azalea nor James Stuart was wanting anyone to cut
down on anything.&nbsp; As <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the firm-footed ponies took the
cut-offs, minding neither curve nor steep, the children shouted
with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late?&rdquo; yelled Jim mockingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
said late?&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t be late if we
tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the parting of their ways, and Azalea, who was
leading, turned in her saddle to wave to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, boy,&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, sis,&rdquo; he answered, and turned to follow
the creek, and then to mount the hill at the top of which stood
the district school.&nbsp; But Azalea kept on along the
low-winding road till she came to The Shoals, from whose four
tall chimneys the smoke mounted into the tinted air.&nbsp;
Benjamin, the polite black boy, was at the horse-block to help
her dismount and to lead away Paprika, her pony; and Tulula
Darthula, the maid, opened the door to welcome her.&nbsp; Azalea
spoke a laughing word of greeting and ran on down the corridor to
the schoolroom.</p>
<p>It was a small room, semicircular in shape, opening on the
wintry garden.&nbsp; The rounding portion of the wall was all of
glass, which in summer time gave way to screens, so that it then
seemed an actual part of the garden.&nbsp; Now, the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>polished
panes reflected the flames leaping in the fireplace, and revealed
the frost-fringed hemlocks without.&nbsp; Before the fire sat
Miss Parkhurst, the quiet, gray-eyed governess, and with her,
Carin, the friend whose approval was more to Azalea than anything
else in the world save the love of the new
&ldquo;mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here I am, late!&rdquo; cried Azalea
contritely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please forgive me,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helena Parkhurst gave a pardoning smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think we&rsquo;re ahead of time this
morning&mdash;Carin and I.&nbsp; Take off your things, child, and
come up to the fire.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been trying to have it at
its best when you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Azalea&rsquo;s fingers, stiffened with holding the bridle
reins, made sorry work with her buttons, and Carin flew to her
aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You smell like winter, Azalea,&rdquo; she laughed,
sniffing; &ldquo;all cold and clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed happily.&nbsp; Whatever this blue-eyed,
golden-haired friend of hers did seemed right to her&mdash;nay,
better than merely right&mdash;complete.&nbsp; It warmed Azalea
more than the glow of the room to have Carin snatch her cap from
her, and pull her reefer off, and tumble <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>her with
affectionate roughness into the chair before the blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonial history again this morning,&rdquo; said Miss
Parkhurst after a time.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re to read about
the Delaware and the Virginia Colonies, since Carin&rsquo;s
ancestors came from the first and Azalea&rsquo;s from the
second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ll be different enough, won&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; remarked Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were different
sort of folk before they crossed the Atlantic, and their
differences grew after they settled here.&nbsp; And yet here
Azalea and I are, as alike as can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think the differences of the
colonists grew, Carin,&rdquo; said Azalea, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
terribly afraid you and I aren&rsquo;t alike.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t be like you if I tried for ever and
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave a wistful sigh, and Miss Parkhurst,
watching her without seeming to do so, saw the light of
hero-worship in her eyes.&nbsp; She knew that Azalea was one of
those who are born to love hungrily, and to live eagerly; and she
was thankful that, having so hungry a heart, she was able, when
it came to a matter of opinion, to form her own ideas, and to
hold to them.&nbsp; Azalea&rsquo;s heart was in leading strings
to Carin, but her excellent <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>little brain went on its independent
way, though Carin had traveled and studied, and been all her life
with charming and cultivated people, and Azalea had been tended
no more than a patch of wayside daisies.</p>
<p>Miss Parkhurst brought the books they were needing from the
library, and Carin taking hers, sighed happily:
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful to be here by
ourselves&mdash;just the three of us?&nbsp; No one else would
fall into our way of doing.&nbsp; How nice it is of you, Miss
Parkhurst, to let us follow up whatever idea we&rsquo;re
interested in, and to help us learn all we can about that
subject, instead of making us dash from one thing to another,
till we haven&rsquo;t a notion what we are trying to learn.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d never get anywhere, studying in the old-fashioned way,
jumping from subject to subject, and having to wait for a whole
class of stupid creatures to come tagging along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you might be the stupid one, you know,
Carin,&rdquo; smiled Miss Parkhurst.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid it doesn&rsquo;t do to go around the world supposing
yourself to be the cleverest one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I always think Azalea the cleverest one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
only saying that <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>we three understand each other, and that we don&rsquo;t
have to spend half our time explaining, and that we&rsquo;re just
as contented together as mortals can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then the door opened and Mrs. Carson came into the
room.&nbsp; Her face had lost something of the look of
transparency it had worn when she first came to Lee, when she had
been fresh from a terrible sorrow, but it was still pale and
strangely tender to Azalea&rsquo;s admiring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Miss
Parkhurst,&rdquo; she said in her soft voice, &ldquo;for breaking
into the study hour.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve something important to
talk over, and so I&rsquo;ve come while all the members of the
academy are together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook hands with Azalea as she spoke, and patted Carin
caressingly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to talk to
you about taking in another girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another girl!&rdquo; cried Carin in dismay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What girl, please, mamma?&rdquo;&nbsp; She had sprung to
her feet, and stood before her mother with the color sweeping
over her face; but Azalea, keeping her thoughts to herself, grew
paler, and pinched the edge of the table in her effort to keep
the tears <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>of vexation and disappointment from coming to her
eyes.</p>
<p>Another girl!&nbsp; And this perfect possession of Carin would
be taken from her, and there&rsquo;d be, as Carin put it, need to
&ldquo;explain&rdquo; all of the time.&nbsp; How could Mrs.
Carson spoil such a perfect thing as their association
there?&nbsp; Who else would love to study, and to write, and
paint and sing the way they did?&nbsp; Who else would make a game
out of it all, and long to get to the schoolroom in the morning
and hate to leave at night?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Annie Laurie Pace,&rdquo; went on Mrs.
Carson, apparently taking no heed of their misery.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you met her?&nbsp; Perhaps not, since she goes to the
Baptist Meeting House, and you, Azalea, are such a faithful young
Methodist, and Carin goes with me to the Episcopal Church.&nbsp;
But anyway, I think you must have seen her&mdash;a tall girl,
with red hair.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been helping me some at The
Mountain Industries rooms, and I&rsquo;ve become well acquainted
with her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s ahead of anything she can get at the
district school.&nbsp; Of course I don&rsquo;t mean that she
couldn&rsquo;t do more mathematics and that sort of thing, but I
am convinced that she has a strength and originality of thought
which is very <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>unusual.&nbsp; She came here this morning to borrow some
books I had offered to lend her, and I have been talking with her
for the last hour.&nbsp; I am so convinced that the work here
under Miss Parkhurst and with you two shining little stars will
give her precisely what she is hungering for, that I have invited
her to join you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mamma,&rdquo; expostulated Carin,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be wretched with her!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a nice
enough girl, I&rsquo;m sure, and no doubt she&rsquo;s bright, but
she&rsquo;ll never be able to really understand Azalea and me,
will she, Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea said nothing.&nbsp; She was dreadfully
embarrassed.&nbsp; She was wondering if Mrs. Carson had some
secret reason for forcing another girl in with them?&nbsp; Could
it possibly be that she&mdash;Azalea&mdash;who had been a
wandering child, traveling with coarse people in a low circus,
was, without knowing it, doing harm to Carin?&nbsp;
Perhaps.&nbsp; Carin was so fine, so gay, so sweet, so
&ldquo;like a flower&rdquo; as the song had it which Mrs. Carson
sang, that very likely she seemed no more than a weed beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably that is all I am&mdash;a horrid, stupid
weed,&rdquo; said Azalea to herself bitterly as her <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>thoughts
flashed this way and that like troubled birds, seeking for what
was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see how Azalea hates the idea, mamma,&rdquo;
said Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;And as for me, if that girl comes in
here, my education will be ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked a haughty and determined young person as she stood
there, her chin lifted and her blue eyes darting cold
fires.&nbsp; Mrs. Carson had a twinkle in her eye as she surveyed
her.&nbsp; Carin had been a gentle princess in the schoolroom,
with Miss Parkhurst for her willing guide and Azalea her adoring
servitor.&nbsp; The truth was, the two girls had become so bound
up in each other that they saw nothing beyond their own
horizon.&nbsp; The dark-eyed girl from the mountain cabin, with
her strange, romantic history, and the blue-eyed one from the
mansion, loving romance above all imaginable things, had made a
compact of undying friendship; and unconsciously, they had also
determined to exclude the rest of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may seem a little hard for you and Azalea to take
Annie Laurie in just at first, Carin,&rdquo; Mrs. Carson went on,
with no show of yielding&mdash;indeed, quite as if everything
were settled&mdash;&ldquo;but she desperately needs the
schooling, and I <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>believe that, without realizing it, you need her.&nbsp;
What do you think, Miss Parkhurst; am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the increasing dismay of the friends, Helena Parkhurst
nodded her nice little head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the chief reasons why a girl should go to
school,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Carson, smilingly, &ldquo;is to learn
to get along with other girls.&nbsp; You and Azalea are so
wrapped up in each other that you actually don&rsquo;t see other
girls as they pass you on the road, and it never seems to occur
to you to visit their homes, or to ask them here.&nbsp; It has
been borne in upon me for some time that if I don&rsquo;t watch
out, you&rsquo;ll become a pair of horrid little snobs.&nbsp; Of
course you wouldn&rsquo;t know that you were, and equally of
course I wouldn&rsquo;t admit it to anybody else.&nbsp; But such
would be the case, I feel sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, we wouldn&rsquo;t, we
wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; protested Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just try us
a little longer and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that moment there came a knock at the door, and Mrs.
Carson arose to open it.&nbsp; The girls could see without in the
hallway the figure of Annie Laurie Pace, the red-haired,
surprisingly tall girl whom they had occasionally seen <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>in town; and
now it occurred to each of them that they had not particularly
wished to know her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say I was to come down here, Mrs. Carson, after
I had found that book?&rdquo; she asked shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carson impulsively, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t say that, Annie Laurie, but now that you are here,
come in and meet my daughter and her friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She entered with a quiet dignity, and it took but one second
for Carin and Azalea to see that here would be no timid imitator
of their whims.&nbsp; If &ldquo;follow-my-leader&rdquo; was
played, it was not at all certain that they would be in the
fore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carin,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carson, recovering herself from
a moment&rsquo;s embarrassment, &ldquo;make your new schoolmate
welcome.&nbsp; Annie Laurie Pace, Azalea McBirney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin held out a chilly white hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said stiffly.</p>
<p>Azalea arose and gave her hand to the new girl.&nbsp; She had
been a stranger herself&mdash;had many a time been among men and
women unknown to her, waiting wistfully to see if she would be
welcomed&mdash;and she understood, as Carin could <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>not possibly,
what brought the veiled look in the new girl&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
Yet she could not venture to offend Carin&mdash;her own Carin,
whose ways always seemed charming to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she echoed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&mdash;I hope you are well, Annie Laurie.&nbsp;
This&mdash;this is a very&mdash;pleasant school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words stuck in her throat, and she was ashamed to find how
much she wanted to cry.</p>
<p>The new girl looked toward Mrs. Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought I to stay, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know I could manage at the other school some
way.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do us a favor if you stay with us,&rdquo; Mrs.
Carson said.&nbsp; And: &ldquo;Yes, stay, my dear,&rdquo; urged
Helena Parkhurst, making the girls realize for the first time
that Annie Laurie had not been presented to Miss Parkhurst, and
that the two must have been acquainted before.&nbsp; How long,
the girls wondered, had this conspiracy been in the air?&nbsp;
Had it really been decided only that morning?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take up your studies to-day, then, Annie
Laurie?&rdquo; Miss Parkhurst asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Carson, do
you think her father would object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can telephone him,&rdquo; Mrs. Carson replied.&nbsp;
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>&ldquo;We
already have had some conversation about the matter.&nbsp; He has
been thinking of sending Annie Laurie away to school, but to do
such a thing, he said, would leave him very, very lonely, since
Annie Laurie is his only child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it could be managed,&rdquo; the girl broke
in.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know it could, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carson raised a white hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be quite all right,&rdquo; she said with gentle
firmness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Parkhurst, you have three
pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She withdrew smilingly; and in spite of the leaping flame in
the fireplace, and the sunshine stealing like pale gold in at the
window, a chill settled down over the room.&nbsp; It crept into
the farthermost corners, and gleamed cold as little bergs from
the eyes of the three girls.</p>
<p>The three girls?</p>
<p>There were two girls&mdash;and one girl.&nbsp; And the sum was
not yet three.</p>
<h2><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ANNIE LAURIE PACE</span></h2>
<p>Annie Laurie Pace was making ready for church.</p>
<p>Her Sunday frock of dark blue serge lay on the bed; her silk
petticoat rustled as she stepped briskly about the room; and her
heavy coat and gloves, and her hat with the ostrich plumes, were
primly awaiting her need.&nbsp; All was durable about her
clothing, and orderly within the room.</p>
<p>A very clean room it was, somewhat bare and bleak, with a
ceiling too high for its size.&nbsp; The floor was uncarpeted,
the walls white and without pictures.&nbsp; No unnecessary thing
was in sight&mdash;not even a pretty foolish trinket on the
dresser.&nbsp; Through the windows with their dark green shades
Annie Laurie could look out into the dairy yard with its
whitewashed houses.&nbsp; Beyond stretched the pastures in which
grazed the fine herd that was the pride of her father, Simeon
Pace.</p>
<p>Usually, Annie Laurie sang as she dressed for <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>church.&nbsp;
She had a warm full voice, with notes in it not unlike the
whistle of an oriole.&nbsp; But this morning no song came from
her lips.&nbsp; She had a set, almost stern look; her chin came
out a little farther than was necessary, and there was battle in
her eye.</p>
<p>Her aunts, dressing in the next room, spoke of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie Laurie is not herself,&rdquo; declared Miss Adnah
to Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can see that she is terribly put
about.&nbsp; I do hope and pray that we haven&rsquo;t made a
mistake in letting her leave the district school and go in with
Carin Carson and that other girl.&nbsp; It looks to me as if Mrs.
Carson was the only person that wanted her&mdash;except, perhaps,
the governess, Miss Parkhurst&mdash;and staying where we&rsquo;re
not wanted is not a thing that we could ever put up with, we
Paces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about Annie Laurie, sister,&rdquo;
replied Miss Zillah, setting her queer lid-like hat on her short
gray curls.&nbsp; &ldquo;She made the change of her own free
will, remember.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s run up against a stone wall for
the first time in her life, and I&rsquo;ll be interested to see
whether she climbs over or burrows under it.&nbsp; Those two
girls she&rsquo;s studying with don&rsquo;t like her&mdash;or at
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>least they
don&rsquo;t like to have her intruding on them.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know as I blame them very much.&nbsp; There they
were, enjoying each other&rsquo;s society, and in comes a
stranger and thrusts them apart, you may say.&nbsp; Annie Laurie
is as unlike them as she can be&mdash;quite of a different class,
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Adnah snapped the fasteners of her gloves sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a different class, sister?&rdquo;
she said reprovingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it possible you consider
the Paces inferior to anyone in this community?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Adnah dear, I didn&rsquo;t say anything about
inferiority.&nbsp; I spoke of a difference.&nbsp; What the Paces
know, they&rsquo;ve mostly taught themselves; and what they have,
they&rsquo;ve honestly earned.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re proud of
it.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re no prouder of being what they
are&mdash;well-to-do, reliable, respectable members of the
community&mdash;than the Carsons are of being highly cultivated,
rich, much-traveled gentle-folk, or the McBirneys of being
industrious, independent mountain people.&nbsp; The truth is,
Adnah, if there were fewer kinds of pride in this community, and
less of each kind, it would be a better thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;The team is up, aunts,&rdquo; called Annie Laurie
in her clear voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, child; we are ready,&rdquo; came the
reply.</p>
<p>Of course they were ready.&nbsp; It was seldom, indeed, that
anyone in that house kept anyone else waiting.&nbsp; Simeon Pace,
holding his fine large grays in check, knew almost to a second
how long before the front door would open and three tall, upright
figures emerge.&nbsp; And this morning was no exception.&nbsp; At
the right instant his sisters, in their well-preserved cloaks,
came out together, followed by his daughter.&nbsp; The door was
locked, the key placed in the crotch of the sycamore, the aunts
were helped to their places by Annie Laurie&rsquo;s strong arms
and then she swung herself into the seat beside her father, and
took the reins from his hands.&nbsp; As she did so, she happened
to hit her father&rsquo;s left arm, which gave forth a sound like
the rattling of an eave trough in the wind.</p>
<p>And truth to tell, it was made of the same material, for where
Simeon Pace&rsquo;s muscular member of flesh and blood had once
swung, there now was an unjointed tin substitute for it, hollow
as a drum.&nbsp; An ill-advised visit to a sawmill five <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>years before
was responsible for this defect, which indeed, might have been
all but concealed had Mr. Pace been willing to buy one of the
excellent modern imitations of an arm.&nbsp; His sisters and his
daughter continually urged him to do this, but Simeon said that
his tin arm had helped him when his trouble was new, and that he
refused to throw it on the trash heap as a reward for faithful
service.&nbsp; It was nothing to him that his gestures startled
nervous folk.&nbsp; He remained loyal to his battered, awkward
tin convenience, and seemed to take an innocent joy in waving it
in the air, offering it as a support to old ladies, and sawing it
up and down when he became excited.&nbsp; All the Paces were
independent and Simeon was the most independent of them all.</p>
<p>He led his women folk well up to the front of the church and
eyed them with critical kindness as they filed past him into the
pew, confident that their thoughts would not wander from the
preacher&rsquo;s words during the service.&nbsp; So it was good
for his fatherly satisfaction that he did not look into his
daughter&rsquo;s mind, for barely a sentence of the sermon did
she hear that day.&nbsp; Her thoughts were slipping back and
forth like <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>shuttles in a loom.&nbsp; The past week in Mrs.
Carson&rsquo;s home has been a strange&mdash;and in some ways, a
distressing&mdash;one.&nbsp; True, never had she learned so much
in so short a space of time.&nbsp; If she asked a question
everyone tried to answer it.&nbsp; Little as the other two girls
had seemed to like her, when it came to a question of ideas, they
paid instant and warm attention.&nbsp; An idea was an idea with
them, and entitled to respect.</p>
<p>If the combined wit of Miss Parkhurst and her pupils failed to
supply a good answer to an inquiry, plenty of books were at hand
to consult, and as a last reference, there were Mr. and Mrs.
Carson, who seemed to have been almost everywhere and to know
something about almost everything.&nbsp; As Annie Laurie had
heard them talk, speaking with interest about all manners of
people, her little local standards began to vanish like mist
before the sun.&nbsp; For the first time it was borne in upon her
that Lee, North Carolina, was not the center of
civilization.&nbsp; All the world, it appeared, was full of
interest&mdash;full of good neighborly folk.&nbsp; All one had to
do was to learn their language to find out how very nice they
really were.&nbsp; It was such a new and <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>brilliant
idea to Annie Laurie that it almost dazzled her.</p>
<p>She had been used to thinking herself a bright girl&mdash;a
girl who could keep at the head of her classes&mdash;so it was
but natural in those first angry hours when she raged at the cold
reception Carin and Azalea had given her, that she should have
thought: &ldquo;Just wait till we get down to lessons, and then
I&rsquo;ll show them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to her surprise, she had not been able to &ldquo;show
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Carin and Azalea did not attack their studies
so fiercely as she did.&nbsp; They seemed to make more of a game
of them and less of a task.&nbsp; They laughed over things that
puzzled her.&nbsp; But for all that they were clever, and it did
not seem strange to them that Annie Laurie should be clever
too.&nbsp; Her cleverness, as they knew, was Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s
excuse for asking her to join them.&nbsp; After that first chilly
day they had been polite enough.&nbsp; But they somehow put her
in the wrong.&nbsp; She felt awkward and strange.&nbsp; She
fatally said the wrong thing&mdash;or the right thing in the
wrong place.&nbsp; Even her clothes had seemed stiff and unlovely
beside theirs, though they were of good material and honestly and
thoroughly made.&nbsp; However, as Annie Laurie had more <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>than once
reflected, their clothes were made for them by their mothers, who
asked nothing better than to see them looking their best.&nbsp;
That Mary McBirney was not really Azalea&rsquo;s mother made no
difference&mdash;she loved Azalea almost as much, judging from
what Azalea said.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie stole a glance at her two excellent
aunts&mdash;always so really kind and just to her&mdash;but
rather stern, like her father.&nbsp; The Paces seldom laughed;
they almost never kissed each other; they said what they
thought&mdash;and they quite lacked that pretty foolishness which
Mrs. Carson sometimes indulged in with Carin.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie could remember that her own mother had been
something like Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; It was she who had given her
the name after the sweet old song.&nbsp; She had laughed and
danced and sung, and the aunts had not quite liked it, although
they mourned her deeply when she died, still in her youth.&nbsp;
And they had treasured as keepsakes the things which had been
hers.</p>
<p>But what was the preacher saying all this time?&nbsp;
Something about Ananias and the doom which overtook him because
of his lies.&nbsp; It was not a subject in which she could feel
much interest.&nbsp; Sometimes, up at her house they suffered <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>from too much
truth telling&mdash;hard, cold truth telling&mdash;but not a soul
of them would have been guilty of a lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plant a lie in the garden of your soul,&rdquo; said the
minister, &ldquo;and it will flourish worse than any poisonous
weed.&nbsp; And do not think that you can uproot it when you
will, for it will grow and grow, till it is stronger than you,
and not all your prayers and tears can tear it out of your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie wondered why he should be talking like that to
those friendly, good neighbors, who seemed to be doing the best
they could&rsquo; from morning till night.&nbsp; She wished he
would talk about something that would help her through the coming
week, for she dreaded going back with those girls who did not
like her.&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t preachers know what was going
on in the back of one&rsquo;s mind?&nbsp; She looked up wearily
and met the gaze of &ldquo;that Disbrow boy,&rdquo; as her aunts
always called Sam Disbrow, the son of the undertaker.&nbsp; For
some reason they did not like him.&nbsp; They &ldquo;had no use
for the whole kit and b&rsquo;ilin&rsquo; of
Disbrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, someway, Annie Laurie, though she had
grown up with this sentiment ringing in her ears, thought Sam
Disbrow rather a nice boy.&nbsp; At this moment he seemed to <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>be as
impatient as she was at the way the minister was scolding about
liars.&nbsp; Evidently liars failed to interest Sam, also.</p>
<p>It happened that Annie Laurie and Sam were near together as
the people came out of church, and while the rest stood talking
in the bright winter sunshine, they talked, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you liking it at your new school, Annie
Laurie?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>The girl flushed hotly&mdash;it was easy for a person with
such white skin as Annie Laurie&rsquo;s to blush.&nbsp; Sam knew
this and made allowances, but he saw there was something more
than ordinary the matter.&nbsp; He looked at her a moment, half
closing his eyes, and turning his head a little on one side in a
way he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been snubbing you&mdash;those
girls!&rdquo; he declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew they
would&mdash;knew it as well as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you could know that,&rdquo; said
Annie Laurie with a sudden feeling that she ought not say
anything against Carin and Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the
nicest girls I ever knew; the nicest girls anywhere about
here.&nbsp; If I haven&rsquo;t been able to&mdash;to make them
understand me, it&rsquo;s my own fault, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Sam.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not nice if they&rsquo;ve been making you
unhappy.&nbsp; How can you let them do it?&nbsp; No fellow could
put it over me, now, I tell you.&nbsp; If he didn&rsquo;t treat
me fair and square, I&rsquo;d have it out with him.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;d soon see who was the best man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls don&rsquo;t do things that way, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know they don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; They sit around and mope
and sniff and feel mean, instead of making a good healthy
row.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think you were such a
hypocrite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hypocrite?&rdquo; gasped the girl, too surprised to
feel angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;How am I a hypocrite, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re pretending to be contented when
you aren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You probably act as if you liked those
girls.&nbsp; And you don&rsquo;t&mdash;you can&rsquo;t&mdash;if
they&rsquo;re snubby.&nbsp; I say, stir up a fuss.&nbsp; Have a
row.&nbsp; Tell &rsquo;em what you think of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; That
will clear the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m under too many obligations to Mrs. Carson to
do a thing like that, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obligations!&rdquo; snorted Sam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody is
under obligations to be a doormat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the way home the girl kept thinking of what Sam Disbrow
had said to her.&nbsp; She would have liked to talk the whole
matter over with <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>her Aunt Zillah, but something held her back from
complaining of the girls.&nbsp; Deep down within her was the
feeling that if only she could manage right, they would yet be
friends, true, &ldquo;forever and forever&rdquo; friends.&nbsp;
If that should prove to be so, it wouldn&rsquo;t do for this one
and that one to be remembering that she had criticised them.</p>
<p>And yet, how they had tormented her with their way of seeing
and yet not seeing her, and answering and yet not
answering.&nbsp; And she was lonely&mdash;desperately
lonely.&nbsp; She longed to see the gleam come in the
girls&rsquo; eyes when they looked at her, which they turned upon
each other.&nbsp; All the long, quiet Sunday afternoon she
thought of it, though she tried to read.&nbsp; She knew Azalea
and Carin were together, for she had heard them planning a
horseback ride, while she was alone, and as she told herself
sadly, likely to be alone every Sunday, since she knew no one she
really wished to be with&mdash;save those two, of course.</p>
<p>She had an hour of trying to hate them, but she failed
miserably.&nbsp; For all they had made her suffer, she could not
get as far as hating them.&nbsp; She failed to sleep well that
night.&nbsp; Her mind <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>whirled like a merry-go-round, always
bringing back the same thoughts and persons.&nbsp; Azalea and
Carin, Carin and Azalea.&nbsp; The bright and charming faces kept
returning, but never once did they seem to bear the smiles of
friendship and understanding.</p>
<p>Naturally she was far from being herself when she went down to
breakfast the next morning, and when her Aunt Adnah said,
&ldquo;You see to it, Ann, that you&rsquo;re not put upon there
at Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s,&rdquo; her patience snapped like a
wind-filled bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please leave me alone, Aunt Adnah,&rdquo; she cried
hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of myself all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, my dear,&rdquo; murmured Miss Zillah,
&ldquo;ought you to be speaking like that to your Aunt
Adnah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie knew very well that she ought not, and she was
morally certain that if Carin and Azalea could have heard her,
they would have cried: &ldquo;There, see!&nbsp; You call her a
nice girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, maybe she wasn&rsquo;t a nice girl, but certainly she
was an unhappy one.</p>
<p>She put her head up as high as she could <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>comfortably
carry it on her very slim neck and marched away to school.&nbsp;
It was a wonderful winter morning&mdash;the sort that got into
the blood of horses and made them prance.&nbsp; Perhaps it was in
Annie Laurie&rsquo;s blood, too, as she entered the schoolroom
that morning.&nbsp; Miss Parkhurst had not yet come, and Carin
and Azalea sat together laughing over some charts of the South
Sea Isles.&nbsp; Miss Parkhurst had laid out an interesting
course for them, all relating to the Archipelago; and geography,
history, biography, poetry and fiction were to be woven together
until the life of the &ldquo;burning isles&rdquo; appeared before
them in a series of vivid mental pictures.</p>
<p>If Annie Laurie had been aware of the amount of explosive
material in her brain and heart that morning, perhaps she would
have had the discretion to remain at home.&nbsp; She really was
about as dangerous as a keg of gunpowder, and it chanced that
Carin&rsquo;s first words were as a match to produce the
inevitable explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d care about reading
Stevenson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ebb Tide,&rsquo; would you, Annie
Laurie?&nbsp; Not, I mean, as a part of the South Sea
study?&rdquo;&nbsp; She put the question in that cold, <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>detached
little voice which she had used from the first to the &ldquo;new
girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t expect a thorough
person like yourself to enjoy such an unbusiness-like way of
getting at things.&nbsp; I said to Miss Parkhurst that probably
Azalea and I had better keep that for reading after hours, and
during school we&rsquo;ll study any old Smithsonian Institute
reports you and she manage to look up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little click in Annie Laurie&rsquo;s throat, but
no spoken word.&nbsp; Carin, looked up, saw the anger blazing in
the girl&rsquo;s eyes, and started to say that she was only
joking; but before she could frame the words Annie Laurie found
her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I like to read Stevenson as well as
you two?&rdquo; she demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you make out
that I try to do things in the hard and stupid way?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve certainly made them hard and stupid enough for me
the past week.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re supposed to have such fine
manners, and Azalea is thought &lsquo;so sweet.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t seen your fine manner or her sweetness.&nbsp; I
imagined it was going to be lovely here with you two&mdash;that
my life would grow to be interesting when we three were
friends.&nbsp; Well, perhaps it would&mdash;if we could <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>be
friends.&nbsp; But we can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; First, because you
won&rsquo;t be&mdash;and second because I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m through.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t have come.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m disgusted that I gave you a chance to snub me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going now, and after this when you poke fun at me
you&rsquo;ll have to do it behind my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;Annie Laurie&mdash;&rdquo; gasped
Carin, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Annie Laurie already had left the room and was stalking
down the corridor.&nbsp; Carin sank back in her chair and covered
her face with her hands.&nbsp; As for Azalea, her book crashed to
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Carin,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what have we
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Parkhurst still was absent, but if she had been there, it
is doubtful if the girls would have consulted her.&nbsp; The
battle which had been threatening all week was on, and the
victory at present was, oddly enough, with the fleeing enemy.</p>
<p>She was already out of the front door by the time Azalea had
reached the hall; and once she was in the open, her dignity
deserted her and she ran toward the gate as if fleeing from a
lava stream.&nbsp; Azalea, who had stopped to snatch her cap and
reefer, reached the gate only to see her <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>racing along
the road as fast as her long legs would carry her.</p>
<p>Meantime, Hi Kitchell, the boy who had traveled with Azalea in
those old, half-forgotten days, and who was now happily settled
with his mother and &ldquo;the kids&rdquo; in the cabin in which
the Carsons had placed them, opened his sharp eyes to see two
girls racing along the frozen road, stumbling over hard ruts, and
then plunging on again.&nbsp; He knew them both&mdash;liked Annie
Laurie and swore by Azalea.&nbsp; He saw the anger in the first
girl&rsquo;s face and the anxiety in Azalea&rsquo;s every
gesture.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t for the life of him see why, if
Annie Laurie felt like that, she didn&rsquo;t turn around and
&ldquo;baste&rdquo; Azalea.&nbsp; But if she did he&rsquo;d be on
Azalea&rsquo;s side all right enough.</p>
<p>Goodness, how they were running!&nbsp; He simply
couldn&rsquo;t stand not knowing what it all was about.&nbsp; He
knew it was none of his business, but for all of that, a second
later he was pelting down the road after them.&nbsp; He could run
like a rabbit and it was not long before he overtook them.</p>
<p>But that was just at the moment when Annie Laurie reached her
home and, dashing in, slammed the door behind her; and Azalea,
panting on the doorstep, furiously rang the bell.</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TRIAL WITHOUT JURY</span></h2>
<p>Miss Adnah was washing dishes in her spotless kitchen when the
inner door burst open and a wild-eyed Annie Laurie stood before
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child!&rdquo; gasped Miss Adnah.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie stood panting breathlessly, her hands on her
sides, her eyes blazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you said I wasn&rsquo;t to let myself be put
upon,&rdquo; she managed to say at length.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I had my say.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m through,&rdquo; she went on shrilly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To-morrow I&rsquo;ll go back to the district school.&nbsp;
The other thing wasn&rsquo;t for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The anger in her eyes began to give way in misery.&nbsp; Miss
Adnah stared at her, trying for once to get at the girl&rsquo;s
point of view.&nbsp; Then came the frantic ringing at the
bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us,&rdquo; cried Miss Adnah, &ldquo;what can
that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, aunt.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you go.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s Azalea McBirney.&nbsp; She followed me.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;Stand out of my way, Ann.&nbsp; How can you put
yourself between me and the door?&nbsp; When the bell rings, it
is to be answered.&nbsp; I do not approve of your actions, allow
me to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then the breathless voice of Azalea was heard in the
hall.&nbsp; Miss Zillah had got to the door before them, and had
admitted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to talk, my dear,&rdquo; they heard
Miss Zillah saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever it is, it can wait till
you get your breath.&nbsp; Come in, please, and sit
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the kitchen, Annie Laurie was declaring that whatever came
she would not go into the parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t talk the matter over, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use for you to
try to make me go in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Adnah moved back from her niece with a look of
displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better quiet down, Ann,&rdquo; she said
severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what you&rsquo;ve
done or what&rsquo;s been done to you, but I do feel certain that
you are making a mountain out of a molehill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment something bobbed up at the window and then
bobbed down again.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;Mercy, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Miss
Adnah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A head,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A head!&nbsp; Whose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Kitchell&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He must have seen us running
and followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inquisitive little imp!&nbsp; A pretty sight the
three of you must have made.&nbsp; Never have I heard such goings
on in the house of Simeon Pace.&nbsp; Let me pass, Ann.&nbsp; I
must look into this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie never yet had disobeyed when her aunt spoke in
that manner, and she stood aside, lifting her eyebrows with
annoyance at the &ldquo;Ann&rdquo; which was the sign of Miss
Adnah&rsquo;s displeasure.&nbsp; She began to grow a little
calmer, but at the same time the feeling of heaviness at her
heart increased.&nbsp; It actually seemed as if it had turned
into a stone and was dragging her down.&nbsp; And worse still,
there was a hand of iron at her throat.&nbsp; That sharp despair
of the young was upon her&mdash;that foolish despair, which sees
no way out of hard circumstance.</p>
<p>Meantime Miss Adnah had gone on into the hall.&nbsp; She had
meant to make her way at once into that grim parlor upon which
her best efforts at cleanliness were so rigorously expended, but
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the sound
of voices made her pause.&nbsp; She heard a girl&rsquo;s excited
voice broken by tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re Annie Laurie&rsquo;s aunt,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which aunt,
please?&nbsp; Her aunt Zillah?&nbsp; Oh, yes.&nbsp; She has told
me about you.&nbsp; Oh, Miss Pace, it&rsquo;s so dreadful!&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve broken Annie Laurie&rsquo;s heart, that&rsquo;s what
we&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t intend it, you
know.&nbsp; It came about because&mdash;may I tell you
everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell me everything,&rdquo; answered Miss
Zillah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course Zillah will be soft with her,&rdquo; thought
Miss Adnah.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s soft with everybody.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like to go in and shake her&mdash;upsetting Annie
Laurie like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were long panes of glass running down beside the front
hall door, and at this moment the ferret face of Hi Kitchell,
seamed with anxiety, peered in one of them.&nbsp; This was really
too much for Miss Adnah.&nbsp; She rushed to the door and threw
it open, sending Hi off backward into the althea bush.&nbsp; It
was no trick at all for Miss Adnah to stoop and pick him up as if
he were a slug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you unmannerly, prying <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>boy?&rdquo;
she demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peeking in folk&rsquo;s windows, like
you were a wild Indian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you&rsquo;re doing to Azalea,&rdquo;
squealed Hi defiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Azalea&rsquo;s all right,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want anything done to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she wasn&rsquo;t invited here any more than
you,&rdquo; snapped Miss Adnah, dropping him on the brick
walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;You run home and leave us to conduct our own
affairs.&nbsp; Hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aunt!&rdquo; Annie Laurie whispered agonizingly,
&ldquo;Azalea will hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stay in the kitchen, miss?&nbsp;
You seemed very anxious not to leave it a few minutes ago.&nbsp;
I won&rsquo;t have boys looking in my windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only Hi.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s crazy about
Azalea&mdash;like her little brother, you know.&nbsp; Azalea will
think we&rsquo;re dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful?&nbsp; We may be a terror to evil
doers&mdash;well, hear that telephone, will you?&nbsp; Ringing
like mad.&nbsp; Never did I know such a morning.&nbsp; No,
I&rsquo;ll answer it, Ann.&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp;
Yes.&nbsp; The Pace residence.&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Carin
Carson.&nbsp; Very well, what is it?&nbsp; Yes, Ann is
home.&nbsp; All right?&nbsp; Of course she&rsquo;s all
right.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t she be?&nbsp; You want to speak
to her?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s busy just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>&ldquo;Oh, oh, don&rsquo;t speak like that, aunt,&rdquo;
implored Annie Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not in that tone of
voice.&nbsp; Let me have the telephone, Aunt Adnah,
please&mdash;please.&nbsp; I was bad, honestly, aunt&mdash;not at
all the way I ought to have been.&nbsp; Carin&rsquo;s sorry, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Adnah had hung up the receiver, and she turned toward
Annie Laurie with a stormy look in her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I did you an injustice, Ann.&nbsp; It must
have been something pretty bad they did to you.&nbsp; You can
back down as much as you please, but for my part I mean to teach
them that if they think they can fool with the Paces, they are
making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my child,&rdquo; the clear tones of Miss Zillah
could be heard saying from the drawing room meantime, &ldquo;why
didn&rsquo;t you like Annie Laurie?&nbsp; She seems the nicest
sort of a girl to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve taken care of her&mdash;I
and my sister, that is&mdash;since she was a little one, and
she&rsquo;s all that a daughter should be to us.&nbsp; Of course
I realize that we may not have succeeded in taking her
mother&rsquo;s place to her.&nbsp; That was hardly to have been
expected.&nbsp; But we have done the best we could for her, and
when we saw her coming on <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>in school so splendidly, and realized
that she was likely to do something fine, we were very proud
indeed.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you how grateful we were to Mrs.
Carson for giving her a chance for special instruction, and for
being in with girls like you and Miss Carin.&nbsp; But we saw
from the first that something was going wrong.&nbsp; The child
seemed too excited to eat.&nbsp; Once or twice I&rsquo;ve heard
her cry out in the night&mdash;she sleeps next me, and after
she&rsquo;s asleep I open the door between our rooms so as to
hear if anything goes wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a very silly habit it is,&rdquo; muttered Miss
Adnah from the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say any more, Miss Pace,&rdquo; Azalea
broke in with a sob in her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;If anybody in this
world ought to have been good to Annie Laurie it is myself, for I
haven&rsquo;t any mother, either, you know, though of course Mrs.
McBirney is as good to me as any mother could be.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t explain the way we&rsquo;ve acted.&nbsp; It all came
about from Carin and myself having some lovely secrets together,
and games we liked to play that we didn&rsquo;t want to share
with any one.&nbsp; And we were writing poems, and Carin was
painting me.&nbsp; We were happy in each other all the
time.&nbsp; Then <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>Annie Laurie came and&mdash;and we didn&rsquo;t know
her.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference who the
girl was that broke in on us, we wouldn&rsquo;t have liked
it.&nbsp; Mrs. Carson said we were getting selfish and snobbish,
and I suppose we were.&nbsp; And Annie Laurie was proud,
too&mdash;and&mdash;and well, a little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it, my dear.&nbsp; I am not laboring under the
delusion that Annie Laurie is wearing a halo on her
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sulky.&nbsp; So she didn&rsquo;t give us a chance
to see the&mdash;the nice side which she simply must have since
you love her so.&nbsp; And we wouldn&rsquo;t show ours to
her.&nbsp; We were all stupid, I think.&nbsp; But of course we
didn&rsquo;t have an idea how she really felt until this morning
when she got so angry.&nbsp; And then I was&mdash;was just
paralysed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk very well, my child, for a person suffering
with paralysis.&nbsp; I can see very well how it came about,
however.&nbsp; Now may I ask why you came here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say how sorry we were&mdash;and to beg Annie Laurie
to come back with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you the right to do this?&nbsp; Did Mrs.
Carson tell you to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea, who had been sitting on the very edge <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of Miss
Zillah&rsquo;s horsehair sofa, now got to her feet, her face
flaming till it was almost as red as her knitted reefer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said frankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&mdash;she
didn&rsquo;t tell me to come, Miss Pace.&nbsp; I just ran after
Annie Laurie as hard as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very sweet it was of you, my dear.&nbsp; It shows
you have a generous heart, and that you couldn&rsquo;t imagine
Mrs. Carson or her daughter would feel any differently from
you.&nbsp; But you can see for yourself that I must wait till I
hear from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have heard from them,&rdquo; cried Annie Laurie
eagerly from the hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Carin telephoned, Aunt
Zillah; but Aunt Adnah wouldn&rsquo;t let her talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not, indeed,&rdquo; came the voice of
Aunt Adnah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come in, Annie Laurie, please,&rdquo; cried Azalea,
running toward the hall door.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie made a motion as if for flight, then brought
herself up sharply, and faced Azalea.&nbsp; Miss Zillah had
arisen and stood smiling and trembling a trifle, too, like a rose
bush softly shaken by the wind.&nbsp; Her lips moved slightly,
and Annie Laurie, flashing a glance at her as <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>she came into
the room, understood that Aunt Zillah was putting up one of her
gentle supplications for peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Annie Laurie,&rdquo; Azalea burst forth,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask you to forgive me.&nbsp; You
really, really must.&nbsp; I had no idea how you were
feeling.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m terribly unhappy about it.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you think you can forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there for me to forgive?&rdquo; asked Annie
Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want me&mdash;you and
Carin&mdash;and you showed it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all there is to
it.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t bother you any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want you now,&rdquo; declared Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can see yourself that it would be impossible for Carin
and me to be happy with you leaving that way, all hurt and
angry.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t blame you a bit, really.&nbsp; Except,
of course, I think you shut up like a clam when you saw that we
didn&rsquo;t like a third person in the classes.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t that we objected to you in particular.&nbsp; We were
selfish, that&rsquo;s all, and fond of our own good times; but it
won&rsquo;t be like that again, honestly it won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Your aunt says I mustn&rsquo;t speak for Carin and Mrs. Carson,
and I see that I mustn&rsquo;t, but I know so well that I am
saying just what they would want me to say, that I can&rsquo;t
keep still.&rdquo;&nbsp; She <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>turned toward Miss Zillah, and caught
the worn hand of the woman in hers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d be saying just what I am, if they
were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy again!&rdquo; exploded Miss Adnah from the
hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking in the hall window
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only poor Hi,&rdquo; explained Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see, he&rsquo;s always afraid something is going to
happen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I had my way, it would,&rdquo; snapped Miss
Adnah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sister, sister,&rdquo; murmured Miss Zillah.</p>
<p>And just then the eyes of Azalea and Annie Laurie met.&nbsp;
There was a flash between them and then something
exploded&mdash;exploded in helpless laughter.&nbsp; Miss Zillah,
unable to believe her senses, called faintly, &ldquo;Adnah!&nbsp;
Adnah!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Adnah, on the point of making another
sortie into the yard for the prying Hi, answered her appeal, and
came to the parlor.&nbsp; There she saw the two girls in
convulsions of laughter, and Zillah stiff and incredulous on the
piano stool.&nbsp; Miss Adnah surveyed the scene for a moment in
wrath.</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;Come, Zillah,&rdquo; she commanded, and dragged
her sister from the room.</p>
<p>The girls heard the kitchen door slam behind the two, and
rocked again with painful mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; half-sobbed Annie Laurie at length,
&ldquo;how ridiculous we&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful,&rdquo; agreed Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just as ashamed of myself as I can be.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I go and
apologize to your aunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on any account,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never understand.&nbsp;
Never!&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t expect them to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come back with me, Annie Laurie?&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re bound to like each other now after we&rsquo;ve
laughed together like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie gave a final gurgle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
out and tell Hi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just let&rsquo;s walk out together, arm in
arm.&nbsp; That will make it all right.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s never,
never tell anyone what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then.&nbsp; And you think I ought to go
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it.&nbsp; You must go on Carin&rsquo;s account
and on mine&mdash;just prove we&rsquo;re not so horrid as you
thought us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang again.&nbsp; They could hear <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Miss Zillah
begging to be allowed to answer it and Miss Adnah refusing.&nbsp;
So Annie Laurie took down the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Carson,&rdquo; Azalea heard her say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Annie Laurie.&nbsp; Yes, Azalea is
here.&nbsp; Forgive Carin?&nbsp; Yes, Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; I reckon
it was my fault, too.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t
<i>your</i> fault, whosever it was, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve been bad, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Everybody is bad
sometimes, I suppose.&nbsp; I never was so horrid before, though,
honestly.&nbsp; You say Carin never was, either.&nbsp; Well,
I&rsquo;m coming back now.&nbsp; Azalea and I were just
starting.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Oh, yes, we&rsquo;ll not talk
of it.&nbsp; Very well, Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if we go right along
we&rsquo;ll be able to finish our South Sea Island study
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her head in the kitchen door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye,
aunts,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Try to forget about it
all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie Laurie,&rdquo; came the austere voice of her Aunt
Adnah, &ldquo;how can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie ran in and threw her arms around her aunt&rsquo;s
neck.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;Because I have to, auntie,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;to be happy and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And good,&rdquo; broke in Aunt Zillah.&nbsp; She
followed them out into the hall.&nbsp; Her pale face was shining,
and her short curls bobbed about on her trembling head.&nbsp; She
knew that her prayer for peace had been answered.&nbsp; It did
not matter to her that it had come in gusts of laughter.&nbsp;
Miss Zillah was not one to quarrel with ways and means.</p>
<p>As for the girls, they set out on the road with vigor.&nbsp;
The air was full of life, the mountains were brown beneath their
purple bloom, and the roadway was beginning to fill with folk
driving in to market.&nbsp; Azalea and Annie Laurie knew almost
every one&mdash;knew Mr. Disbrow, the undertaker, driving his
black horses&mdash;which now were hitched to a somewhat rickety
buggy&mdash;they knew &ldquo;Haystack&rdquo; Thompson, who was
eating up the road with his great strides, his fiddle under his
arm; they knew Elder Mills, twisted and tormented with
rheumatism, who was about to &ldquo;accept a call&rdquo; in
Florida, thus leaving vacant the pulpit of the Methodist church;
they were well acquainted with the grocer, and the miller, and
the postmaster, and the sheriff.&nbsp; From each <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>they received
a salutation, and from most of them an inquiry as to why they
were not in school.&nbsp; Annie Laurie, used to the &ldquo;yea
and nay&rdquo; of the Pace household, wondered what they ought to
answer, and she was astonished that Azalea had no difficulty at
all in finding a fit reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve been to school this morning,&rdquo; she
said smilingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve learned a hard
lesson, too.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;re on our way back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they had got no more than half the way to The Shoals when
the familiar surrey of the Carsons appeared, with Mrs. Carson
sitting in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; cried Annie Laurie, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
coming for me!&nbsp; What trouble I have put everybody
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Carson didn&rsquo;t seem to think that anybody was
making her trouble.&nbsp; She wore that pleasant, dreamy smile of
hers&mdash;her &ldquo;moonlight&rdquo; smile, as Carin called it,
and her voice was as even and low as ever as she bade Benjamin
turn the horses, and invited the girls to get in beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come to meet you,&rdquo; she said
blandly, and quite as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; They rode
along together in silence for a while, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>almost wondering if anything
unpleasant really had occurred, Mrs. Carson seemed so unconscious
of it.&nbsp; But when they got out of the carriage at the house
door she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve talked everything
out.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find it much better always, I
believe&mdash;to talk things out.&nbsp; By the way, Carin is up
in her studio.&nbsp; Lessons are to be up there this morning, for
a change.&nbsp; Azalea, will you kindly show Annie Laurie the
way?&nbsp; Your luncheon will be served there too.&nbsp; We
thought we&rsquo;d celebrate the formation of the Triple
Alliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Three Girls&rsquo; Alliance,&rdquo; smiled Mrs.
Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drive back to town, please Ben.&nbsp; I must
do my marketing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she rode off, Annie Laurie looked at Azalea in a puzzled
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How quiet she is,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t make her out.&nbsp; Nothing seems to matter to her,
yet she&rsquo;s always doing good.&nbsp; I never heard of anyone
who did so much good.&nbsp; Can you understand her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;and yet a great sorrow, such as hers&mdash;it
makes you still, I reckon.&nbsp; My mother&mdash;I call <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Mrs. McBirney
my mother, you know&mdash;is still.&nbsp; Yet she has lost only
one child, and little Molly died right in her arms.&nbsp; But
Mrs. Carson lost her three sons in a theatre fire in Chicago, and
it did something to her, I suppose.&nbsp; The heart went out of
her, though not the goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear no,&rdquo; agreed Annie Laurie, &ldquo;not the
goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left their outer wraps in the vacant schoolroom, and then
made their way up the wide mahogany stairs, with the gleaming
white banisters and mahogany rail.&nbsp; Curious old prints lined
the side of the wall, and Annie Laurie wanted to pause and look
at them, but Azalea urged her on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you stopped to look at every interesting thing in
this house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d never get
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on past the floor where the bedrooms were, and then
up a narrower flight of stairs to the third story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half of this story is Carin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; explained
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;The servants sleep in the other
half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall, curious door, much paneled, with a shining brass knob,
stood before them.&nbsp; There <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>was also a knocker of brass, shaped
like a lyre.&nbsp; Azalea rapped with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the voice of Carin, and Azalea
threw wide the door and motioned Annie Laurie to enter.</p>
<p>What she saw then she was never to forget.&nbsp; It was as
bright to her, as different from anything she ever had seen, as
the green Azores are to one who has ridden long upon the gray
Atlantic.&nbsp; The room was paneled high in white, and above it,
decorations of tropical flowers and parokeets made the wall
gay.&nbsp; Muslin curtains hung at the dormer windows, beneath
draperies of delicate green.&nbsp; Near the north window was
Carin&rsquo;s easel, with the unfinished portrait of Azalea upon
it.&nbsp; Chairs of green wicker stood about; a huge divan was
piled with dainty pillows; in the white wooden fireplace, with
its tiles of parrots, palms and pagodas, a bright fire
burned.&nbsp; Japanese rugs of gray and white lay on the floor,
and in jars of pale green, or gray, were beautiful blossoming
plants.</p>
<p>But exquisite as the room was, and deeply as it satisfied
Annie Laurie&rsquo;s beauty-starved heart, it was as nothing to
the girl who was the center of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>In her crimson school frock, soft and <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>graceful, her
golden hair shining on her shapely head, her eyes full of tears
of repentance, Carin stood awaiting them, her hands
outstretched.&nbsp; It all seemed so different from what Annie
Laurie knew of her, that at first she hesitated to go forward,
but Carin came on, still with that look of solicitude in her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Annie Laurie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see
everything now.&nbsp; I see how I acted and how I made you
feel.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to forgive me.&nbsp; I never was
like that before.&nbsp; It was as if imps got inside me, and the
worst of it was that I seemed to want to hang on to them.&nbsp; I
knew I was wicked, but I liked to be that way.&nbsp; I just
wouldn&rsquo;t give up, though I was unhappy all the time.&nbsp;
I told mother all about it, and she said that was the way it was
when you got perverse.&nbsp; You liked it.&nbsp; Perversity
seemed sweeter than anything.&nbsp; She said it was like being a
drunkard.&nbsp; You enjoyed the thing that ruined you.&nbsp; I
can see just what she meant.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you now, Annie
Laurie, that after the first day or two I found myself liking
you, and I hated to admit it.&nbsp; I tried not to as hard as I
could.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like mamma&rsquo;s putting a girl in
with us without talking it over, do you see?&nbsp; But I do like
you&mdash;I had to.&nbsp; The whole <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>trouble was that I couldn&rsquo;t
bear to give up.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ve made me, and now
I&rsquo;m well again.&nbsp; For it&rsquo;s just like a spell of
sickness, having a horrid, wicked idea like mine and holding on
to it.&nbsp; Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie&rsquo;s face had flushed softly; her eyes were
misty, her handsome, large mouth slightly tremulous.&nbsp; She
withdrew her hands from Carin&rsquo;s, and put her arms close
about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I say I forgive,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie laughed deep in her throat&mdash;and again her
voice reminded one of an oriole&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do say it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother
called it the Triple Alliance&mdash;the Three Girls&rsquo;
Alliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must swear fealty!&rdquo; cried Azalea.&nbsp; She
ran to the table and brought back Howard Pyle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Robin Hood,&rdquo; in which the story of the forester and
his faithful crew is told in equally beautiful words and
pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear!&rdquo; she commanded.&nbsp; Carin, laughing
somewhat uncertainly, dropped her slender white hand on it.&nbsp;
Annie Laurie laid her firm brown one over it; Azalea placed on
top her <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>sensitive, odd hand, which always quivered when she
cared about anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We swear,&rdquo; they said in chorus.</p>
<p>The door opened and Miss Parkhurst entered, her arms full of
books.</p>

68</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A RAINY NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>After that, the short days of winter passed as happily for the
three girls as days can be expected to pass in a world which some
discouraged person called &ldquo;a vale of tears.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Alert as their minds were, each was decidedly different from the
other, and they had the effect of spurring each other on.&nbsp;
Carin was, of course, really more interested in her drawing and
painting than in anything else, although she was a good student,
too.&nbsp; Annie Laurie simply devoured books, and her happiest
diversion was music.&nbsp; A good teacher came weekly from
Rutherford, a town near by, to give her instruction.&nbsp; But
Azalea took neither drawing nor singing lessons.&nbsp; She had
much housework to do before and after school, and her long ride
down the mountain each morning and back again at night, with the
fatigue it entailed, had to be taken into account.&nbsp; Then she
helped with the sewing and with the weaving, and so had neither
time nor strength for <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>anything else.&nbsp; Once Mrs. Carson
said to her husband:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we were wrong not to insist on having Azalea
live with us.&nbsp; It is true that few children have so much
love and care given them as she has there with the dear
McBirneys.&nbsp; But she has to share their poverty too, and
their hard work.&nbsp; Do you think she will be worn out,
Charles?&nbsp; Children seem so precious to me.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t bear to see their strength wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, she is being made into a very capable
girl,&rdquo; Mr. Carson answered reassuringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
is having the sort of training our pioneer ancestors had, and
they grew stronger for their tasks and hardships.&nbsp; You and I
are not going to live forever, you know, and our Carin will never
want to take up the work we&rsquo;re doing here among the
mountain people.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be off to Paris or Rome, I
suppose, picture seeing and making.&nbsp; But here&rsquo;s
Azalea, in the most practical arts and crafts school
possible.&nbsp; She sees the mountain handicrafts made every day
right before her eyes, and when she&rsquo;s grown she&rsquo;ll be
able to teach others.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll come in here and take up
the work where we leave off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Carson,&rdquo; cried his wife indignantly, <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>shocked for
once out of her sweet placidity, &ldquo;what do you mean by
speaking of us as if we were old?&nbsp; Why, we&rsquo;re hardly
middle-aged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; said Mr. Carson rather wearily,
yet smiling too.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, Lucy.&nbsp;
Sometimes it seems to me as if I had lived a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife was silent.&nbsp; She knew what he meant.&nbsp; Who
could know better?&nbsp; The day of blight that took from them
their three fine sons had left them disinclined to go on playing
the game of life.&nbsp; They had tried many things, and at length
had come into this quiet valley, where there was so much
uncomplaining poverty, where the people had latent talents that
only needed encouragement to make them bread-winning forces, and
they had endeavored to make themselves necessary.</p>
<p>They had bought the beautiful old home that long years before
had belonged to Azalea&rsquo;s grandfather, Colonel Atherton, and
they had showered their favors right and left and tried to make
their influence felt in all parts of the county.&nbsp; Their love
of doing something, of building up, was as a fresh wind blowing
in a sultry plain.&nbsp; For a lassitude had hung over the <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>beautiful
valley of Lee&mdash;a lassitude born of long years of loneliness,
lack of opportunity and monotony.&nbsp; Too little had happened;
there had been too few ways of earning money; too few strangers
had come that way.&nbsp; One day was so like another that a spell
lay upon the people, and they moved as in a long dream.&nbsp; But
it was different now.&nbsp; There was some use in making the
strong, hand-woven cloth, the durable, quaint chairs and the
curious baskets, for Mr. Carson saw that they were profitably
marketed.</p>
<p>Mr. Carson had induced the mother of Hi Kitchell, a little
worn woman with three children to support, to come down from the
mountains and oversee his industries for him.&nbsp; He had given
her a little home on the level spot known as the Field of Arrows,
an ancient Indian camping ground, and here the young women came
to learn the weaving of baskets and of cloth.&nbsp; The front
room was the shop, where the people came to buy these interesting
wares.</p>
<p>Here, too, the three girls came sometimes after school for a
cup of tea and some homemade cake&mdash;for Mrs. Kitchell served
these comforts to all who wished them&mdash;and sitting around
her fire, they listened to her stories and told tales of their <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>own
adventures.&nbsp; Sometimes there would be a dozen or more in the
tea room, whiling away the tedium of a winter afternoon.&nbsp; Hi
and the other children helped with the serving, and now and then
&ldquo;for the fun of it&rdquo; Jim McBirney or Sam Disbrow took
a hand.&nbsp; There always was plenty to do at the Mountain
Industries, it seemed, however slack work might be elsewhere.</p>
<p>One day of cold rain, Azalea and Annie Laurie had stopped in
at Mrs. Kitchell&rsquo;s for a cup of tea before they made their
way to their distant homes.&nbsp; There was no one there that
afternoon, save the sharp-eyed, busy Mrs. Kitchell, and she,
having served them, went back to the loom-room and left them to
themselves.&nbsp; The girls were excellent friends now.&nbsp;
They trusted and admired each other&mdash;counted on each other,
as true friends should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie, &ldquo;I never
understood rightly about your &lsquo;cousin Barbara.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve heard you speak of her, but I&rsquo;m not quite clear
as to who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t really my cousin at all,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no kin, Annie Laurie.&nbsp; But I have
told you, have I not, how my poor mamma and I <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>were
traveling with a dreadful show when she died; and how we had got
as far as the McBirney&rsquo;s cottage, and Ma McBirney&mdash;as
Jim calls her&mdash;had my dear mamma buried right there near the
house, where her own little Molly&rsquo;s grave is?&nbsp; Then
she asked the show people to let her take me, and they
wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And so the dear, brave thing took me
anyway, and ran away up into the mountains with me and hid with
me in a cave.&nbsp; And Pa McBirney and some of his friends
stayed down at the house, with shotguns, and scared the show folk
away.&nbsp; Well, Sisson, Hi Kitchell&rsquo;s uncle, who was at
the head of the show, was terribly angry, and he made up his mind
he would have me back again.&nbsp; So one time, when we all went
off to a &lsquo;Singing,&rsquo; he managed to get me, and to
carry me away, and for weeks I was taken from one place to
another in the mountains, away off the beaten tracks, always
hiding.&nbsp; Oh, it was such a time, Annie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the other sympathetically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course I heard about that.&nbsp; We were all so
excited, wondering if you&rsquo;d be found, and I just cried when
I heard that you were, and that good old Haystack Thompson was
bringing you home.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know you&mdash;and I
couldn&rsquo;t even <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>remember having seen you&mdash;but I felt interested in
you from that moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps you heard that I managed to run away from
the people who were hiding me, and I went down the mountain in
the night, and came to the little town at the foot of it, and
crept into a house there, and into a sleeping-porch with a bed in
it.&nbsp; Oh, I was so tired&mdash;so tired it was almost like
dying.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t really remember getting in that bed;
but I was found there in the morning by Mr. Summers, who is a
Methodist minister, you know.&nbsp; His wife is Barbara
Summers.&nbsp; And they have the dearest baby you ever saw or
heard of&mdash;Jonathan Summers, he is, bless him.&nbsp; Well,
Mrs. Summers is just a little dear thing with brown
eyes&mdash;she&rsquo;s no bigger than I am.&nbsp; And from the
minute we saw each other, we loved each other and felt at
home.&nbsp; So we decided that we&rsquo;d be kin.&nbsp; I write
to her one week, and she writes to me the next.&nbsp; She sends
me pictures of Jonathan that she takes with her little camera,
and I send her presents when I can&mdash;little woven
table-covers or baskets.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no idea how sweet she
is, Annie Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to make friends whenever you please,
Azalea.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so easy for you!&nbsp; The Paces <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>aren&rsquo;t
like that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard for them to let themselves go
and say the thing that comes into their minds.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
stiff, someway.&nbsp; But when we do make friends, we keep
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to keep me, Annie Laurie.&nbsp; I nearly lost
you through my own carelessness, and I mean to hang on to you
now.&nbsp; Well, come, let&rsquo;s start for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as it turned out, it was raining most dismally.&nbsp; A
dark cloud had tumbled off the mountain and settled down over the
valley, and though it was not late, it seemed almost like
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness me,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like to think of you riding away up on the mountain a
night like this.&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;d be drenched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have accepted Carin&rsquo;s invitation and
stayed all night with her,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother doesn&rsquo;t expect me on bad nights.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s not to worry about me if I don&rsquo;t come when it
rains or snows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stay with me, Azalea!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just the
chance I&rsquo;ve been wanting.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve never been in
my home except on that funny day when we all had conniption
fits&mdash;especially Aunt Adnah.&nbsp; But, honestly, Aunt Adnah
is a brick if you know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Azalea
giggled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, she did seem to have some of the
properties of a brick&mdash;hardness, for example.&nbsp; She hit
me between the eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;ll make it up to you now, if
you&rsquo;ll give her a chance.&nbsp; Of course she
wouldn&rsquo;t say that she wants to make up, but she
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just love to stay all night with you,&rdquo;
Azalea said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the pony back to the
Carsons&rsquo; stable, and then we&rsquo;ll walk over to your
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go with you to the
stable.&rdquo;&nbsp; They put the pony in the stall, and then,
wrapped in their raincoats, tramped along over the red pine
needles to Annie Laurie&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel at all backward, will you,
Azalea?&rdquo; the other girl said as they stood on the
doorstep.&nbsp; &ldquo;You just have a little pluck and
everything will come out all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t half understand me yet, Annie
Laurie,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so much more
serious than I am.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help enjoying things even
when they are serious.&nbsp; I know I oughtn&rsquo;t to feel that
way, but I think it will be awfully funny to see your Aunt
Adnah&rsquo;s face when she finds I&rsquo;ve had the impudence to
come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Annie
Laurie frowned a trifle.&nbsp; She was not quite sure she liked
to have her aunt regarded as amusing.&nbsp; However, they went in
together.&nbsp; The door of the grim little parlor was closed,
but the living-room door stood open and Annie Laurie led the way
in.&nbsp; There was an ugly brussels carpet on the floor, and a
center table covered with a chenille cloth; on it was the reading
lamp, and ranged about it were comfortable chairs.&nbsp; A black
marble clock ticked noisily on the mantel shelf, and a low fire
smouldered among the ashes.&nbsp; The scrim curtains had many
colored figures in them, and helped to keep out the light of the
declining day.&nbsp; Azalea could not help contrasting it with
the exquisite rooms at The Shoals, and with the quaint, charming
rooms in the McBirney cabin.&nbsp; She could understand some of
the bitter things that Annie Laurie had said to her&mdash;could
see that, somehow, life had been commonplace for this girl from
the first, and that, though she did not altogether realize it, it
was this common-placeness which made her dissatisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever can the aunts be?&rdquo; said Annie
Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fire is out in the kitchen, and there
are no signs of supper.&nbsp; Usually at this <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>hour, things
are humming like a bee hive.&nbsp; Take off your things,
Azalea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hang them up where they&rsquo;ll
dry.&nbsp; You sit right down before the fire, and I&rsquo;ll
bring in some wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me help, Annie Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re company.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
often have company.&rdquo;&nbsp; She went away with
Azalea&rsquo;s things and then came back and stood looking at her
guest with her glowing eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Azalea,&rdquo; she said
intensely, &ldquo;I never have company!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
supposed to want it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m to study and work, and mend
and practice my music, and be doing something from early till
late.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t that they&rsquo;re not kind to
me&mdash;my aunts and my father&mdash;but they&rsquo;re so
dreadfully serious and conscientious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>does</i> throw a damper over everything, being
conscientious like that,&rdquo; mused Azalea.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie looked startled to hear her own secret idea put
in words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
let the aunts hear you say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really like to try that on Aunt Adnah,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Annie
Laurie was getting used to her friend, and she made no
reply.&nbsp; She ran upstairs for a moment, and came down clothed
in a warm brown wrapper, and carrying another one of equally
uninviting color on her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slip into this, Azalea,&rdquo; she commanded,
&ldquo;and let me hang your dress out in the hall near the
heater.&nbsp; There now, lie down on the sofa&mdash;so.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll lie down too with my head the other way, and
we&rsquo;ll wrap ourselves in my grandfather&rsquo;s old army
blankets.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dead tired, aren&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see <i>where</i> the aunts are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She yawned wearily, and Azalea caught the contagion and
stretched her pretty mouth in imitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s cosy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Azalea
murmured.&nbsp; Neither spoke again.&nbsp; Their eyes were fixed
on the smouldering coals, which seemed to hypnotize them, and
presently they both slept.</p>
<p>Just how long they lay there, comfortably resting, Azalea
could not tell, but when she opened her eyes the twilight had
deepened.&nbsp; Annie Laurie was still deep in sleep.&nbsp; The
fire had quickened, and by its glow Azalea could see that some
one had entered the room.&nbsp; For a moment she was startled,
but then she saw that <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>it was Annie Laurie&rsquo;s father,
Simeon Pace; so she lay still, not liking to speak, since she was
not sure he would know her.&nbsp; He did not see the two girls on
the sofa, and it was quite evident that he thought himself
alone.&nbsp; Azalea watched him sleepily, and saw him take off
his coat and throw it on the chair.&nbsp; Then he began twisting
his arm in a most inhuman manner, and Azalea&rsquo;s blood was
frozen as she saw him loosen it at the elbow and lay it beside
the coat, until she chanced to remember about its being merely a
tin substitute for an arm.&nbsp; His next act was to take a long
pocketbook or wallet from the mantel, draw something from it,
stuff it into his hollow arm and deftly strap the arm into place
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny,&rdquo; thought Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;How Jim
will laugh when I tell him about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she remembered that she had been unintentionally spying,
and that it would not be at all fair to tell what she had
seen.&nbsp; She knew Ma McBirney would not like her to mention
anything she had seen under such circumstances.&nbsp; So she lay
as still as a lizard, hardly breathing, and finally Mr. Pace left
the room.&nbsp; A moment later she heard the two aunts bustling
about in <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>the kitchen.&nbsp; There was a poking at the stove, a
lighting of lamps, a rattling of dishes, and it was evident that
the household was being set in motion again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you, Annie Laurie, child?&rdquo; called the
voice of Miss Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been out to the
sewing circle, and it was so late before the refreshments were
served that we couldn&rsquo;t hold our business meeting till
after five.&nbsp; Then on the way home we heard Mrs. Disbrow was
worse and Hannah laid up with a cold and we dropped in to see
them, though I must say they&rsquo;re a shiftless lot.&nbsp; We
thought you and your father wouldn&rsquo;t mind if supper was a
little late.&nbsp; What you lying there for, child?&nbsp; And
mercy me, how big you look!&nbsp; Why, no wonder, there&rsquo;s
two of you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you, Azalea?&nbsp; How do you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Azalea
rather shyly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t mind my
coming.&nbsp; It was so rainy and horrid, Annie Laurie asked me
to spend the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re as welcome as sunrise, of
course.&nbsp; Sister Adnah, here is Azalea McBirney.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s come to spend the night with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea wondered what was going to happen <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>then.&nbsp;
Miss Adnah had been quite vicious on the occasion of her former
visit; but the mischievous spirit in the girl made her rather
enjoy the uncertainty.&nbsp; Miss Adnah, she decided, could do no
more than eat her up.&nbsp; But Miss Adnah was over her bad
temper.&nbsp; She came in holding out her hand gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a wise thing for you to stay in the valley
to-night,&rdquo; she said primly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
Mrs. McBirney wouldn&rsquo;t want you to climb the mountain in
such a drizzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She avoided committing herself to a mere piece of
flattery.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t say she was glad Azalea was
there, but for some reason, the girl did not feel chilled.&nbsp;
She knew Annie Laurie wanted her, and it seemed to her that as
the daughter of the house, Annie Laurie ought to enjoy some
privileges.&nbsp; However, a few minutes later, when she was in
Annie Laurie&rsquo;s sober, tidy room, putting on her dress and
freshening her hair, she overheard Miss Zillah saying softly to
Annie Laurie in the next room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Adnah thinks you should not invite anyone to the
house without first asking permission, my dear.&nbsp; As for
myself, I&rsquo;m glad to see <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>you have friends and feel free to ask
them, but it would be well to make certain
preparations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Aunt Zillah,&rdquo; answered Annie Laurie
hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a girl to stay all
night&mdash;never.&nbsp; I asked Azalea because it was
raining.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t tell it was going to rain, or
that I was going to ask her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m old enough now to
use some sense, I hope, and I want it so that I can act without
first having a period of fasting and prayer.&nbsp; You and Aunt
Adnah were late to-night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, it is the first time we have been late to our
duties, so far as I can remember, since we assumed
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t understand at all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
glad you were late.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t you be, if you
wished?&nbsp; And your duties&mdash;why do you speak of what you
do in the house like that?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a duty to live
and work and eat and sleep and all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
pleasure.&nbsp; At least, that&rsquo;s the way Carin and Azalea
look at it.&nbsp; What I wanted to say was that for once you
acted on impulse.&nbsp; You stayed till meeting was out, and you
stopped in to see some sick neighbors.&nbsp; Well, I think
that&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp; Now, I asked my friend to stay all
night.&nbsp; No preparation is needed.&nbsp; The cellar is <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>bursting with
food, the pantry is plumb full of it; there&rsquo;s milk and
cream to float a town and butter enough to grease all the engines
in the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie Laurie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Aunt Adnah wears my patience out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
going to ask my friends here when it seems best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you know we only ask you to use
judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judgment?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what that
means.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll use hospitality, if you like, and
courtesy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your aunts, among others, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart!&rdquo; Azalea heard Annie Laurie cry
softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear, Aunt Zillah.&nbsp; Was
I ever rude to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not directly, my dear child.&nbsp; But you sometimes
speak of my sister in a manner which I cannot regard as really
respectful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Aunt Zillah.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve too much
mustard and pepper in my disposition.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s the
supper bell.&nbsp; Azalea!&nbsp; Azalea, are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat down at a bountiful table, and Simeon Pace folded his
hand of flesh and his hand of tin together and prayed long and
loud&mdash;something about the &ldquo;sundering of joints and <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>marrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Azalea, who was very hungry, hardly
seemed to get the drift of these words.&nbsp; But she was
startled from her dazed reverie by a sharp inquiry from Mr.
Pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you two girls were asleep there before the fire,
were you?&nbsp; Did you see me when I came in?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
turned his large eyes&mdash;so like and yet so unlike Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s&mdash;upon first one girl and then the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Miss Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I awoke while you were in the room,&rdquo; she said,
feeling somewhat like Jack when he talked with the Giant
Eater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; he looked at her sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t sure you&rsquo;d know me,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused a moment and sat steady under the
look he kept upon her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway, I was just as good as
asleep&mdash;half dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never tell your dreams, I hope?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a bad habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea smiled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never, never tell them, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; cried Simeon Pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sensible
girl <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>wouldn&rsquo;t, of course.&nbsp; Let me serve you some
meat, Miss Azalea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she understood clearly that she had given a tacit promise
that she would not tell what she had seen; and Simeon Pace felt
the reliable character of her, beneath her soft, girlish aspect,
and trusted her.</p>

87</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SUMMERS</span></h2>
<p>While they were at supper a strong cold wind sprung up, so
that Mr. Pace had to heap wood on the fire.&nbsp; And afterward,
when the two girls ran to the door, they could see that the sky
had cleared and the stars were out, looking, it seemed, unusually
large and bright and sociable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not go to prayer meeting?&rdquo; said Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your church or mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you don&rsquo;t mind, Annie Laurie, at mine this
time.&nbsp; Dear old Elder Mills is leaving, you know.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve heard how sick he is with the rheumatism,
haven&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going down to Florida where
the climate will be better for him.&nbsp; They say he&rsquo;s
wonderful these last few weeks.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s trying to say
everything he can think of that will help the people he&rsquo;s
known so long.&nbsp; I love to hear people talk when they are
really, really in earnest, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Annie
Laurie looked at her friend understandingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just like me, Azalea; you always want mountains
to be higher than they really are, and stars brighter, and
sermons deeper, and friends more loving.&nbsp; Nothing is ever
quite big enough to suit me&mdash;nor quite <i>hard</i>
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not intense enough, Carin would say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; Yes, let&rsquo;s go to prayer
meeting.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ask father if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They presently were on their way, walking briskly because they
were late.&nbsp; The little Methodist church was full of the old
friends of Elder Mills, who as he stood before them, his white
hair hanging around his shoulders, his face haggard with pain,
yet had a look in his eyes of exaltation and joy which seemed to
make a light thing of his physical distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I want you to love one another,&rdquo; he said
during the evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want you to forgive one
another.&nbsp; Be honest, be brave in saying what you think, live
truly, avoid lies.&nbsp; Above everything, avoid lies&mdash;in
word and in act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake,&rdquo; thought Annie Laurie,
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t preachers find anything else to talk about but
lies?&nbsp; Whether I go to my own church or <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>another, that
seems to be the theme.&rdquo;&nbsp; She remembered how she had
caught Sam Disbrow&rsquo;s eye that day at the Baptist church
when the minister had been talking about lies, and how queer it
had been to realize that she was reading Sam&rsquo;s mind, and
could tell that he, like herself, was wondering why the preacher
kept harping on that.&nbsp; Annie Laurie&rsquo;s mind drifted off
to Sam&rsquo;s home&mdash;to his mother who never was well, to
their untidy little house, and to his cross-eyed sister, who
never would make friends with anybody.&nbsp; Sam seemed so
different from the rest of the family, with his hearty downright
ways, his energy, his determination to make something of
himself.</p>
<p>Was meeting over?&nbsp; She aroused herself as from a
dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be a business meeting,&rdquo; Azalea
said to her as the people arose.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re to
talk about who is to be our new minister.&nbsp; Since it is not
conference time, we are to ask for some one we want, and then if
the bishop thinks best we can have him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie vaguely.&nbsp; Though
she did not really see.</p>
<p>The two girls started out together, crowding <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>softly by
their elders who were gathered about in the aisles talking over
the trial that had come to the church in losing Elder Mills, and
in being obliged to bring a new minister in at the middle of the
session.&nbsp; And then, suddenly, a beautiful idea came to
Azalea.&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t they ask the Rev. Absalom
Summers?&nbsp; He was in that tiny backwoods village where there
were so few to hear or enjoy him; and he was such a wonderful
man, all wrapped up in his religion, and talking about it as if
it must be the business of everyone.&nbsp; And if he came, her
&ldquo;pretend cousin&rdquo; Barbara, his wife, would come also,
and that blessed baby, Jonathan.&nbsp; To think was to act with
Azalea, now as always.&nbsp; She broke from Annie Laurie and ran
up to her old friend and protector, Haystack Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Thompson, dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;if
only you could manage to put in a word for Mr. Summers!&nbsp; You
know what he is&mdash;how he talks and sings and laughs and keeps
everybody stirred up.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d put life into any church,
wouldn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s just wasted down in that
little valley where he lives.&nbsp; Hardly anybody comes to
church, and those who do, don&rsquo;t like <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>him.&nbsp;
They think he&rsquo;s too new-fashioned.&nbsp; But here
he&rsquo;d be appreciated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; drawled Mr. Thompson, running his
hand through his wild head of hair&mdash;the hair that gave him
his nickname of &ldquo;Haystack&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know but there might be something in that.&nbsp; He sure has got
a lot of ginger in him, &lsquo;the power of the Lord,&rsquo; he
calls it, and I reckon maybe that&rsquo;s what it is.&nbsp;
Anyway, as you insinuate, Zalie, the Seven Sleepers would have
had a hard time of it trying to keep up their slumbers anywhere
around his neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Mrs. Summers,&rdquo; went on Azalea
breathlessly; &ldquo;think what she would mean to the
church!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s so lively, you know, and so interested
in everyone&mdash;sorry for them when she ought to be, and happy
with them all other times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharin&rsquo; their sorrows an&rsquo; their joys with
&rsquo;em, I reckon you mean, daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and the baby&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, the baby!&nbsp; He&rsquo;d be a
drawin&rsquo; card to any congregation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Thompson, if I could have that baby around
I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d be good all the rest of
my days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a practicin&rsquo; Christian, eh?&nbsp; Well, as you
say, Summers is a mighty fetching man&mdash;don&rsquo;t know of
any with more&mdash;well, more radiation.&nbsp; I reckon
I&rsquo;d better mention him to the bretherin.&nbsp; Perhaps the
bishop would hear to his being moved up this
a-way&mdash;particularly if I told him you was wantin&rsquo; to
play with the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea never cared how much fun her kind old Haystack made of
her.&nbsp; He had followed her over mountains and through
valleys, in sun and rain, in a certain terrible episode of her
life, when she had been stolen away from Mrs. McBirney and all
but forced back into her hateful life with a traveling show, and
she let him joke and fleer all he pleased, knowing him, as she
did, for one of her staunchest friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please do,&rdquo; she urged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just going into meeting now.&nbsp; Just tell
them how he laughs and talks and cuts up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine recommendations for a pastor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are,&rdquo; insisted Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course they are.&nbsp; He wants everyone to be as good and happy
as he is, and if they aren&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;ll find out
why.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>Haystack Thompson brought his huge brows together and
regarded Azalea with his sharp eyes.&nbsp; Neither spoke for a
moment.&nbsp; Then: &ldquo;Yes-sum,&rdquo; he said, and moved
toward the front to join the representative members of the
congregation.</p>
<p>So it came about that a month later Azalea had the great
happiness of knowing that her friends, the Reverend Absalom
Summers and his wife and baby were coming to Lee as the result of
her suggestion.&nbsp; It was rather a joke among those who knew
of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Azalea&rsquo;s choice&rdquo; they called the
new minister.&nbsp; But it was no joke to Azalea.&nbsp; It meant
more to her than she ever could explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said to Carin, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
ideas that count&mdash;right ideas.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m a person
of no importance whatever.&nbsp; But because I happened to have
the right idea, those men listened to me and did what I wanted
them to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the point of it all is,&rdquo; laughed Carin,
&ldquo;that if you have enough right ideas and can find enough
persons to listen to them, you&rsquo;ll be important,
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you knew <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>what it meant for me to have the Summerses
come&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know well enough&mdash;know too well.&nbsp; After
they come, what chance will I have of getting your
attention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carin, how can you?&nbsp; No one can take your
place.&nbsp; My friends are all separate.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
spare one, and not one can take the place of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in Carin&rsquo;s pony cart as they held this
conversation, on their way down to the station, and it seemed as
they drove along the one macadamized road in the county, that
everyone they knew was bent in the same direction.</p>
<p>True, it was nighttime, but the lanterns and lamps revealed
the identity of the travelers.&nbsp; Amusements were not many at
Lee, and the coming of the new Methodist minister and his family
was an event worthy of notice.&nbsp; Moreover, the fame of the
Reverend Absalom Summers had gone abroad.&nbsp; His strong bright
gifts, his hearty, brotherly nature, his way of finding nothing
too small for his interest or too great for his inquisitiveness,
had won him friends.&nbsp; So they gathered&mdash;these friendly,
waiting neighbors&mdash;in <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>the draughty little waiting room of
the station and waited for the nine o&rsquo;clock train.</p>
<p>The peculiarities of this nine o&rsquo;clock train were well
known.&nbsp; It had acquired a habit of arriving at about a
quarter of ten, and it was not until the hands of the clock and
of the frequently consulted watches of the male members
approached that hour, that anyone thought of going out to look up
the track.&nbsp; But there it was, sure enough, faithful to the
time it had chosen for itself.&nbsp; Its flaring headlight could
be seen away up the mountains.&nbsp; The air was nipping, and the
company of watchers shivered together, but they would none of
them go back into the station now that the headlight really was
in sight.</p>
<p>Moreover, though they would not say so, they loved to be out
among the mountains&mdash;those mountains that were as the very
soul of their lives, that held them together, that gave meaning
to their secret motives, to their religion, to their daily
work.&nbsp; They loomed now, darkest purple against the starry
sky.&nbsp; The wind swept down from them, fresh with an
indescribable freshness.&nbsp; An owl called&mdash;was
silent&mdash;then called again.&nbsp; Lights shone out from the
houses in the village, and from the scattered cabins <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>along the
mountain sides.&nbsp; Now and then there was a movable light high
on the mountain, as some hill farmer made his way to his house
from a neighbor&rsquo;s, or from his visit to town, or from
looking after his stock.</p>
<p>The headlight disappeared as the train swept around the
horseshoe bend.&nbsp; Then it burst upon them like a menacing
star.&nbsp; It rushed towards them.&nbsp; There was a shriek as
of a giant taken prisoner.&nbsp; The train was there!&nbsp; The
conductor got down and exchanged greetings, and an enormously
tall and thin man appeared, carrying many bundles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the Elder.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s Mr. Summers,&rdquo; cried the people.&nbsp; They
surged forward, pulled the man from the steps, seized his
bundles, and waited while he assisted a little lady to
alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she isn&rsquo;t as large as we are, Azalea,&rdquo;
whispered Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Azalea whispered back, quivering as she
hugged her companion&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Carin was not to know what Azalea had told her, for at
that moment the voice of the little lady was heard saying:</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, for Azalea, a thrilling moment.&nbsp; Afterward,
thinking it all over, she could not tell why her heart so leaped
at that first word.&nbsp; Was it because she had no kin, really,
that this voice of loving friendship was so sweet to her?&nbsp;
Was it that she was proud&mdash;she who had been a wanderer and a
beggar&mdash;to be asked for before all the people?&nbsp; Was it
just abounding love for Barbara Summers, her &ldquo;pretend
cousin&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It made no difference, really.&nbsp; There was Barbara, her
dark eyes shining; there was her babe in her arms, fresh and
wonderful from sleep; and there was his mother offering him to
Azalea.</p>
<p>The two kissed above the baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honey bunch!&rdquo; murmured Azalea, and gathered him
into her arms.</p>
<p>She saw nothing of how the people came forward to make Mr.
Summers and his wife welcome; heard nothing of what Pa McBirney
said to them, urging them into his comfortable old mountain
wagon.&nbsp; Even the voice of Carin was vague in her ears,
though she knew she was murmuring her appreciation of golden
curls and blue eyes, of tiny teeth, of dimples, or <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>chubby little
hands.&nbsp; But nothing that anybody could say would be too
much, Azalea thought.&nbsp; Her hungry heart, never yet
satisfied, with all the love that had come to her, wrapped a
thousand quivering tendrils about this little laughing child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You riding with Miss Carin, Zalie?&rdquo; asked Pa
McBirney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, father.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll drive right
up to the parsonage, won&rsquo;t we, Carin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As fast as Mustard can take us,&rdquo; replied
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;The baby won&rsquo;t mind leaving you a
moment, will he, Mrs. Summers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbara Summers shook her head.&nbsp; She was not given to
passing Jonathan over to the care of others, but there was
something in the satisfied expression of Azalea&rsquo;s face that
forbade her to take him away.</p>
<p>Carin turned the head of the little yellow pony toward the
Methodist parsonage.&nbsp; They had a hill to climb and a dark,
curving little road to traverse.&nbsp; But five or six vehicles
were ahead of them, and Mustard, who felt like a mere boy in the
horse world, and who always was pleased if he could get in a
grown-up affair of any kind, trotted along importantly.&nbsp;
Lights <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>shone out from among the armored pines.&nbsp; Azalea got
out and carried Jonathan through the freshly decorated rooms,
with their newly polished furniture and snowy curtains, to the
bedroom where the little iron cot awaited Jonathan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the door, Carin dear,&rdquo; she whispered
happily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s undress him.&nbsp; His mother
said we&rsquo;d find his nightie in that bag.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SUNDAY</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Once there was a bear,<br />
And he made his pasture there;<br />
And he crept, and he crept, and he crept,<br />
&rsquo;Till he got away up there!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Gurgle&mdash;gurgle&mdash;gurgle!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And once there was a bear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conversation took place between Azalea McBirney and
Jonathan Summers one Sunday morning while Jonathan&rsquo;s mother
was at church.&nbsp; Azalea had been to Sunday-school, and had
run over to ask her &ldquo;Cousin&rdquo; Barbara if she
wouldn&rsquo;t like to attend service to hear her husband
preach.&nbsp; Barbara would&mdash;Oh, most undeniably she
would.&nbsp; It was her firm conviction that if all men could
hear her husband, and would give heed to what he said, they would
be able to resist all temptations and would live in peace with
the world.&nbsp; So she kissed Azalea and permitted her to button
her into her pretty golden-brown frock, and then, clapping her
large hat over her <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>wayward hair and putting on her gloves as she hastened
down the street, she was off, her heart beating high with loving
pride of the man whose life was united with her own, and who had
already found warm friends in his new parish.</p>
<p>Jonathan had been asleep when his mother left him, but it was
not long before he opened his eyes and looked about him to see
whom he could get to serve him.&nbsp; For Jonathan was, in his
own opinion, the Prince of the World, and everyone in it was to
do his bidding.&nbsp; He preferred, of course, his chief
slave&mdash;the one called &ldquo;Mamma&rdquo;&mdash;and not
seeing her, he opened his mouth and let out a more or less
cheerful roar, not so much showing rage, as a healthful imitation
of it.</p>
<p>Azalea was delighted.&nbsp; She picked him up, fed him his
bottle, arranged him among the sofa pillows, and then, taking a
dimpled hand in her own, she pointed delicately to the rosy
palm.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once there was a bear,<br />
And he made his pasture there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must have been a particularly small bear to have pastured
in such a tiny pink palm, but Jonathan saw nothing inconsistent
in it, and remarked enthusiastically:</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;Gurgle&mdash;gurgle&mdash;gurgle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear began creeping slyly up Jonathan&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp;
It snuggled for a moment at his elbow, went on&mdash;and Jonathan
shivered happily&mdash;up to his shoulder, and then settled right
down in his neck, and seemed to think it a good place to
stay.&nbsp; At least, Jonathan laughed delightedly.</p>
<p>Azalea looked at him with her soul in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy me,&rdquo; she sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;How well I
understand kidnappers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she remembered that she had once been kidnapped herself,
and that she had not liked it at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jonathan,&rdquo; she cried, looking at him
critically, &ldquo;it seems impossible that anything as soft and
lovely as you are can grow up to be just a hard, common, big
man!&nbsp; If only I could put you in some kind of a preserve jar
and keep you the way you are, I&rsquo;d just give anything.&nbsp;
Tired of sitting still?&nbsp; Well, come to Azalea, and
we&rsquo;ll go exploring.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pretty house,
isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; But my goodness, you ought to have seen it
a little while ago!&nbsp; It was as dull as Monday washday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when it was decided that your papa <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>and mamma
were coming here to live, we all turned in and worked like sixty
to make it look nice.&nbsp; Haystack Thompson&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the man that throws you up so high, you know&mdash;prepared it
with his own hands.&nbsp; But you make up your mind we
didn&rsquo;t let him pick out the paper.&nbsp; Haystack is a
dear, but he couldn&rsquo;t be trusted to pick out wall
paper.&nbsp; No, sir, my friends Carin and Annie Laurie and I did
that.&nbsp; Brown for the sitting room, and green for the dining
room, and pink and pale blue for the bedrooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we got these pretty print hangings and
covers&mdash;at least, Mrs. Carson paid for them and we picked
them out.&nbsp; And Ma McBirney wove these rugs&mdash;brown for
the sitting room and green for the dining room.&nbsp;
Aren&rsquo;t they beauties?&nbsp; And Mr. Carson had the
furniture done at his shop&mdash;the very best he could
make.&nbsp; And Sam Disbrow, he brought this fern, and somebody
else sent the palm, and Carin gave the pictures, and Annie Laurie
made the table cover, and I don&rsquo;t know what all.&nbsp; You
see, some of these people don&rsquo;t belong to your church at
all, Jonathan.&nbsp; They just gave these things because you were
so sweet that they couldn&rsquo;t bear to have you come into any
but a pretty house.&nbsp; Dear me, <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>boy, stop pulling my hair!&nbsp; You
treat me just as if I were a step-child.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m
not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your pretend cousin&mdash;which is ever and
ever so much nicer than being a real cousin, because you do your
own picking out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan replied after his own manner, and the morning wore on
pleasantly.&nbsp; Azalea put the potatoes and the stew over to
cook, and made some apple sauce.&nbsp; Then she set the table;
and &ldquo;toted&rdquo; Jonathan some more.&nbsp; For once she
forgot to think.&nbsp; The sad little thoughts that would mope
around in the back of her mind, because she was, after all, a
child without a father or a mother, kept entirely out of sight
that morning.&nbsp; She was so busy that she could waste no time
whatever on merely thinking; and the first thing she knew she saw
the people pouring along the street from church.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie drove by with her aunts and her father, and waved
to Azalea.&nbsp; Sam Disbrow walked by with his father, and
Azalea thought what a dull time Sam had of it, with that heavy
looking father with his hanging head and big, rolling eyes, both
going home to a mother who was always sick, and to that queer
sister of Sam&rsquo;s, who had too much work to do, <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>and who
never seemed to want to talk with anybody.&nbsp; And then the
Carson carriage rushed by with black Ben driving, and Mr. Carson,
so handsome and straight, beside him, and Carin and Mrs. Carson
on the back seat in their beautiful furs, smiling and bowing to
everybody.</p>
<p>Then the McBirney wagon came, with Mr. and Mrs. Summers in
with Pa and Ma McBirney and Jim.&nbsp; And Azalea was thanked and
kissed, and had the pain of seeing Jonathan tear himself away
from her to rush to his mother&rsquo;s embrace, and then Azalea
went out and got in with her foster parents, and Pa McBirney
hissed to his horses in an odd way he had, and they started for
their long drive up the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is a mighty curious thing how that man goes on,
Mary,&rdquo; said Mr. McBirney to his wife as they were driving
by the prosperous dairy farm of Simeon Pace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s jest rolling up money, but no one can tell what
he does with it.&nbsp; Heller, the banker, he says nary a cent of
it comes his way.&nbsp; Pace don&rsquo;t believe in
banks&mdash;got stung some time I reckon, and lost his nest egg
by the busting of a bank.&nbsp; Anyhow, he hangs on to what he
gets nowadays.&nbsp; It beats all to see anyone so
old-fashioned.&nbsp; Heller says he <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>supposes he hides it away in his old
stocking or buries it in the yard.&nbsp; I suppose I&rsquo;m
something of a mossback myself, but anyway I know enough to bank
my money when I get it&mdash;which ain&rsquo;t any too
often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t look like such an old-fashioned man,
Simeon Pace don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; mused Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He certainly does keep his place up right smart.&nbsp;
Them cattle o&rsquo; his&rsquo;n is the best to be seen in the
country, and everything around the place is right up in
G.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old-fashioned he is, but he&rsquo;s far-seeing
too.&nbsp; About five years ago he bought the Caruth Valley and
all the uplying land beyond it.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t see what
his idea was, but now I hear that he&rsquo;s selling it out to
Mr. Carson for five times what he paid for it.&nbsp; Mr. Carson
wants it for the water power on it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s adding to
his factory, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will mean work for a good many more of us mountain
folks,&rdquo; observed Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;The way Mr.
Carson has opened up things for us is just stirring to think
about.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as his efforts are appreciated,
but I, for one, know who I have to thank when I see the new
things in the house and the good new clothes <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>we&rsquo;ve
been able to get for the children.&nbsp; Why, only this morning I
was calling Jim&rsquo;s attention to it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at
you,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;in your store clothes and brown shoes
and new overcoat and all.&nbsp; You look like a rich man&rsquo;s
son,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; And I declare to goodness when I got
out this here new cloak o&rsquo; mine, and this bonnet Mrs.
Carson made for me out of silk velvet and a real ostrich tip, I
could hardly believe it was me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so used to
wearing rusty black that I don&rsquo;t know as I feel quite at
home in good deep black like this a-here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim McBirney, who was sitting on the back seat with Azalea,
not caring to listen longer to the conversation of his elders and
knowing it was bad manners to disturb them, began whispering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to Sam Disbrow&rsquo;s house last evening,
sis.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Jim said &ldquo;evening&rdquo; he meant
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you, Jim?&nbsp; What was it like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shades all down&mdash;rooms all hot&mdash;Mrs. Disbrow
lying on the settle&mdash;Hannah sitting by her, knitting and
knitting, and her eyes so crossed you couldn&rsquo;t think how
she could do anything but cross stitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for Hannah.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a
dreadful life to lead&mdash;being shut up all the time with a
sick person.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a good mind to give her a party if
mother will let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Hannah Disbrow a party?&nbsp; Why, she&rsquo;d run
like a hare if she saw anybody coming, and she&rsquo;d drop her
ice cream and go home crying.&nbsp; I know Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke as if he had made girls and their outlandish ways his
particular study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, I&rsquo;m going to see her.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;ll get the other girls to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, th&rsquo; other girls!&nbsp; Why, Zalie, you
can&rsquo;t move around by your lone no more; you&rsquo;re just
hitched on to them friends of yours.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t you ever
going to have any separate thoughts again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed lightly, and at the chime of her merriment Mary
McBirney turned around to look at the occupants of the rear
seat.&nbsp; It was at such times that Azalea loved her
most&mdash;when the light of love flooded her face with its high
brow and soft eyes.&nbsp; It always made Azalea feel as if there
must be a lamp burning there behind the kind face.&nbsp; She gave
a pleasant, inarticulate murmur that served better than words to
let the <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>children know that her love was round about them.&nbsp;
Then she turned back to resume her conversation with her husband,
and the horses&mdash;nimble mountain-climbers&mdash;pulled on up
the road steadily, stopping now and again to breathe, and then
sweeping around another curve of the ever winding road.</p>
<p>Azalea amused herself by noticing the little plateaus or
&ldquo;benches&rdquo; along the mountain side.&nbsp; She played a
little game with herself, building imaginary houses in this cove
or on that bench among the maples.&nbsp; There was one place in
particular, where three lofty tulip trees guarded a spring of
cold water, and where there was a little almost level cove from
which one could look off for miles and miles along the purple
valley, where she put first one sort of a house and then
another.</p>
<p>When she began thinking of it, she built&mdash;in her mind of
course&mdash;a little house of cedar logs, with an open chamber
between, like the one she now called home; but as time went on
she changed her plans.&nbsp; Barbara Summers had tried to
persuade her that a rambling bungalow of pine, with high chimneys
and wide porches would be the thing; and Carin had been in favor
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>of a
cement bungalow with a pergola with trumpet vines growing over
it.&nbsp; Annie Laurie thought it would be better to have a tent
pitched there, and to eat off wooden plates and use paper
napkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you could heave everything into the fire,&rdquo;
said this practical young woman, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;d be no
dishes to wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they passed the place this Sunday Azalea asked Jim what
kind of a house he thought it would be best to put up there, but
Jim was not fond of playing at air castles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-all don&rsquo;t own the land,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and we ain&rsquo;t got the money for the house, so
what&rsquo;s the use of talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea felt just a trifle out of patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of talking,&rdquo; she said rather sharply,
&ldquo;is that it interests you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping still interests me all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, then, if you want to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;ve plenty to think about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that Mary McBirney began singing softly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sweet are the hillsides, pleasant
are the valleys,<br />
Bright is the sky o&rsquo;er the home of my
heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Both
Azalea and Jim knew very well why she was singing.&nbsp; She
never could bear to reprove them; and she had a little theory
that music could drive out any evil spirit.&nbsp; Such music as
she made ought to, certainly, the children thought, sitting for a
moment in silence, ashamed of their stupid quarrel.&nbsp; Neither
one was of the sort to sulk.&nbsp; Jim gave a little twist on his
seat, and joined in the fourth line:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And my home, gentle friend, is
wherever thou art.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Azalea loved the quaint old song.&nbsp; It was one of many
such which Mary McBirney knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see the words and music of the songs
you sing, mother,&rdquo; Azalea had said to her once.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where can I find them?&nbsp; Are they in any of the books
you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mary McBirney had shaken her head with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mountain folks have many a song that never yet has
been writ down, child,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
lonely nights in the little cabins away back on the mountains,
all still and peaceful, the folks weave the songs out of their
hearts.&nbsp; Grandmothers and mothers and daughters have sung
them, and not one of them all had the <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>knowledge to write them down.&nbsp;
They make me think of wild roses.&nbsp; They grow beside the
roadway, and they are the sweetest of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Early in the morning I can hear the thrushes
singing,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mary McBirney sang on, and Azalea, joining
in, put all her love for the sweet woman into the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear as the voice that I love best of
all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stopped at the waterfall for the horses to drink.&nbsp;
The cataract leaped down delicately and gayly from the height
above, paused at the roadway, rippling along among the pebbles at
the edges and rushing between the great boulders in the center of
the ford, and then with a wild laugh plunged off over the edge
and foamed down the mountain side.&nbsp; The sky was rather
overcast on this particular day, and the trees wore a patient
look; even the waterfall seemed subdued, and its rush of sound
was more liquid and less like music than on brighter days.&nbsp;
A heaviness and quietude lay over everything.&nbsp; But the
McBirneys loved the mountain in all its moods, and little by
little they set themselves to fit in with its whims, so that by
the time they reached their home they were quiet, too.</p>
<p>But they were happy&mdash;Oh, most distinctly, <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>they were
that.&nbsp; They loved every inch of the old place.&nbsp; The
cabin of logs, divided in the center with an open air chamber,
the little loft where Azalea slept, looking up the mountain side,
the Pride of India tree beneath which lay the graves of little
Molly McBirney and of Azalea&rsquo;s poor mother, the tulip trees
at the outlook, the little smithy, the stable, the barn, the
smoke house, the corn crib, the chicken house and the bee hives,
the pigeon coops and the swinging gourds where the martins
nested, all were dear to them.&nbsp; Vines, flowers, and bushes
grew all about them.&nbsp; The farm slanted down the hillside at
a dangerous angle, but contrived to soak into its produce the
sweet Southern sun, and it gave of its rich bounty in return for
Thomas McBirney&rsquo;s hard toil.</p>
<p>Human care and enthusiasm showed in every foot of it.&nbsp;
Even the most casual passer-by could see at a glance that here
was a home in which people lived who loved life and each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy and good folk live here,&rdquo; it seemed to
say.</p>
<p>And there were, first and last, a good many to read its
message, for it was on the highway and whoever came over Tennyson
Mountain <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>down to Lee must pass almost through the doorway.</p>
<p>This gray, pleasant Sunday, Mrs. McBirney and Azalea jumped
from the wagon at the house door, and Jim and his father went on
to the stable to look after the horses.&nbsp; The cow was
munching contentedly in her stall, but the chickens seemed a
little depressed and in need of their midday drink of hot water
and their feeding of hot meal.&nbsp; The pigeons cooed chillily
from their cote.&nbsp; As for the horses, they knew almost as
much about unhitching as their betters, and if either Jim or Mr.
McBirney had done anything they ought not to have done they would
have turned their critical eyes upon them.&nbsp; The real pride
of Jim&rsquo;s heart, however, was the two ponies which he and
Azalea rode to school.&nbsp; They had been the gift of Mr. Carson
to them, and they were the brothers of Carin&rsquo;s pony,
Mustard, and bore the exciting names of Pepper and Paprika.</p>
<p>Jim lingered for a moment or two, loath to leave them.&nbsp;
He loved the velvet noses of them the friendly eyes and the warm
heaving sides.&nbsp; They muzzled him, and he put their noses in
his neck and gave them to understand that their affection was
returned.&nbsp; The cool, damp air <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>billowing in at the door was
delicious, and he almost hated to go in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use in living in houses?&rdquo; he
thought.&nbsp; He had known a young fellow who traveled over the
mountains all the time with two ponies.&nbsp; One he rode, the
other carried his pack which consisted of a hammock, a frying
pan, some blankets and a square of canvas, out of which he could,
at need, fashion a sort of tent.&nbsp; He never had slept under a
roof since he was a baby.&nbsp; Jim thought of this boy as a very
fortunate fellow.&nbsp; He chose not to remember the desperate
ill health that had driven the lad into the life.&nbsp; However,
he must go in the house, he must!&nbsp; Ma had got the fire going
in the kitchen, judging from the smoke that rolled from the
chimney.&nbsp; Well, he was glad he didn&rsquo;t have to build
it.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t feel like doing anything just
then&mdash;except, perhaps, sitting by the door and looking off
at the valley.&nbsp; Usually when he wanted to do this, some one
straightway thought of some chore for him.&nbsp; So he slid
softly onto the bench, sitting where he could be seen neither
from the door nor the window, and fell into a comfortable though
somewhat hungry day dream.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>Meantime, odors of frying chicken were wafted to him,
along with the smell of slightly burned corn cake and very good
coffee.&nbsp; The odors grew stronger and pleasanter and after a
time Jim decided that he wasn&rsquo;t doing right to stay outside
while everyone was working in the house.&nbsp; It really was his
duty to go in.&nbsp; So in he went.&nbsp; The fire was leaping,
the table was set, his mother was bustling around in her calico
dress, Azalea was putting the chairs to the table, and his father
looked ready primed for a long Sunday grace.</p>
<p>It proved to be even longer than Jim had feared.&nbsp; Thomas
McBirney was one of those who count it a fault if they neglect to
mention every event of their lives to the Almighty.&nbsp; He
thanked the Lord for their united family, for food and fire, for
roof and friends, for the privilege of attending divine service,
and for the love of God which warmed their hearts.&nbsp; Meantime
his son&rsquo;s eyes wandered restlessly from the heaped plate of
chicken to the bowl of gravy and
&ldquo;fixin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wondered if he would have
no more than a &ldquo;drumstick&rdquo; and why there should be
such intimate relations between boys and drumsticks.&nbsp; The
world over, fathers <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>seemed to think they should go to
their sons.&nbsp; No doubt Chinese fathers held just the same
opinion.</p>
<p>Imagine then, his surprise&mdash;his unbelieving
surprise&mdash;when his father, having first served his mother
and Azalea, took the &ldquo;wish-bone,&rdquo; beautifully
burdened with tender white meat and laid it on Jim&rsquo;s
plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a good boy,&rdquo; he said, as he heaped on the
potatoes and gravy, and passed the corn bread.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once
in a while, Jim, we men folks have to set ourselves against these
here women, eh?&nbsp; Them with their wishbones!&nbsp; Who said
they was to eternally have the wishbones?&nbsp; No king that ever
I hearn tell of.&nbsp; I say, let&rsquo;s head a revolution and
declare that they ken have only every other wishbone.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s fair, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A nice, warm feeling gathered in Jim&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; It
was splendid to have a dad like that&mdash;a dad who could tell
what was going on in a fellow&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; And his mother
and Azalea seemed to be glad he had the wishbone, too.&nbsp; They
were looking at him just the way a fellow likes to have his
family look at him.&nbsp; My, what a nice day Sunday was!&nbsp;
And wasn&rsquo;t he glad he had helped haul those hickory
logs!&nbsp; And wasn&rsquo;t <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the room nice, with the settle there
next the fire, and the old clock tickin&rsquo;, tickin&rsquo;
away, and striking now and then with a voice like Haystack
Thompson&rsquo;s when he led in prayer.&nbsp; And there was a
white table cloth on for Sunday, and Ma was smiling almost the
way she used before Molly died.&nbsp; And the cat was stretching
herself, and outside, Peter, the hound, was sniffling to let them
know he was there and hadn&rsquo;t had his dinner yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious,&rdquo; sighed Jim,
&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t it lucky we&rsquo;re all alive!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SIGNAL</span></h2>
<p>Night came down sweetly over the mountain that quiet
day.&nbsp; It wrapped the village in soft gray folds; the stars
came out hazily and shone with a misty golden light; the wind
merely whispered in the pines and the hemlocks, and the sound of
the falling water was lonely and sad in the ears of Azalea.</p>
<p>Yet she had to be out in the night because&mdash;well,
that&rsquo;s a secret.&nbsp; At least it was a secret from
Jim.&nbsp; Because he would have laughed.&nbsp; She was to signal
the other two girls.&nbsp; It had been agreed upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I nearly die, Sundays,&rdquo; Annie Laurie had
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our house&mdash;really I can&rsquo;t describe
our house on Sunday.&nbsp; I feel as if my heart were turning
into old red sandstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To have the strong-beating heart of Annie Laurie turn into
structural rock was something the friends could not permit.&nbsp;
Anyway it would be an excellent thing for Azalea in the <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>mountain to
know that her friends in the valley were doing well.&nbsp; She
could tell if they were doing well, if the lantern was waved
sideways; if anything was wrong it was to be swung up and
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I reckon you-all had better not swing it up and
down,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;for though I&rsquo;ll know by
that that something is wrong, of course I won&rsquo;t know what
it is.&nbsp; And the waiting to find out would be
dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will have to be a pretty dreadful
&lsquo;something&rsquo; to make us give the bad signal,
won&rsquo;t it, Annie Laurie?&rdquo; Carin had remarked.</p>
<p>So it was with a light heart and a mysterious manner that
Azalea, who was supposed to leave the kitchen-living room to go
to her own little loft, stole out the back way, took the lantern
from its nail, lighted it, and crept to the outlook.&nbsp; She
had five minutes to wait before the time appointed, and these
moments proved to be a &ldquo;perfect caution&rdquo; for
slowness.&nbsp; She counted the seconds to make sure&mdash;and
yet was not sure, for she managed to get in about two counts and
a half to each second.&nbsp; However, at last she felt justified
in bringing out her light from behind the tree bole where she had
hidden it, and <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>waving it back and forth in enthusiastic announcement
that all was right.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t help thinking with a
throb of the heart how very, very right it all was!&nbsp; How
sweet the day had been; how filled with comfort for body and
soul; how beautiful to be loved as she was loved in that little
home!&nbsp; Of course she might have repined that she had not
been made Carin&rsquo;s adopted sister and surrounded with all
manner of luxuries, but the love she felt for Mrs. McBirney was
too deep, too sincere, to permit such a thought to have a place
in her heart for very long.</p>
<p>Yes, her home was a log cabin, and her family simple mountain
people.&nbsp; But she could not feel cheated.&nbsp; The taste of
the Things That Were was sweet on her palate, and her hope for
the future bubbled in her heart as the spring, whose whispering
she could hear, bubbled from the ground.</p>
<p>So back and forth in the gray air went her lantern,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is well!&nbsp; All is well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea actually laughed aloud to think of Carin, all in her
Sunday best, stealing out of that stately drawing-room and
creeping up the <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>stairs to the huge cupola and standing there on the
roof in the wind and night, waving her lantern.&nbsp; What fun it
was to know a girl like that&mdash;a girl who wasn&rsquo;t afraid
to do things, if she was rich and beautiful.&nbsp; There was some
&ldquo;go&rdquo; in Carin, no doubt about it, though she did look
so delicate and alabasterish.&nbsp; Azalea loved to invent words,
and she invented &ldquo;alabasterish&rdquo; on the moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p122.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>But what did that mean?&nbsp; Annie Laurie&rsquo;s lantern,
full and strong and like a star, had shone through the light mist
and was being waved frantically up and down.&nbsp; Mercy! how it
waved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is wrong!&nbsp; All is wrong!&rdquo; it
protested.</p>
<p>What could that mean?&nbsp; Carin, of course, would know in a
few minutes.&nbsp; She would telephone.&nbsp; But Azalea had no
telephone and she would not be allowed to ride to the valley at
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is wrong&mdash;oh, very, very, wrong!&rdquo; the
lantern kept on saying.</p>
<p>What could she do to let Annie Laurie know that she
understood?&nbsp; Poor Annie Laurie, who was brave about
everything!&nbsp; It was a real trouble, Azalea felt sure.&nbsp;
Had one of the aunts fallen and broken a bone?&nbsp; Could Mr.
Pace be <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>ill?&nbsp; Were the cattle poisoned?&nbsp; Azalea took
her lantern and twisted it around and around until it must have
looked to Annie Laurie like a snare of fireflies.&nbsp; Then
Carin, understanding, did the same thing.&nbsp; After that it was
dark on Carin&rsquo;s roof; then Annie Laurie&rsquo;s lantern
disappeared too.&nbsp; They had gone to the telephone, Azalea
inferred.</p>
<p>She stamped back through the dew, hot with impatience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t sleep a wink to-night,&rdquo; she
declared.</p>
<p>She undressed in anguish of soul, sank on her knees and sent
up a fervent prayer for her friend, and then throwing herself on
what she expected and desired to be a sleepless bed, fell fast
asleep.</p>
<p>Yet in her sleep she had many dreams, and in each of them
Annie Laurie appeared, always in some horrid plight.&nbsp; Now
wolves were chasing her; now she had fallen over the cataract;
now the horses were running away with her; now she was speeding
down the road again, away from the scorn of her schoolmates, and
little drops of blood were falling on the road from her shattered
heart.</p>
<p>But none of these things were anywhere near <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the truth,
though nothing could be more terrible to Annie Laurie than what
actually had happened.</p>
<p>It had come about after church.&nbsp; Dinner was over; the
house had been tidied, and the two aunts and Mr. Pace and Annie
Laurie sat in the sitting room before a fine fire.&nbsp; The
aunts had taken out their pious books and were reading
them.&nbsp; Mr. Pace was engaged in plodding sleepily through
somebody&rsquo;s account of the &ldquo;Thirty Year&rsquo;s
War.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for Annie, she was supposed to be writing to
a friend, but as a matter of fact she was scribbling some verses
which she meant to show to the girls the next day.&nbsp; Nibbling
the end of one&rsquo;s pen is more or less of a necessity when
one is writing verses, and Annie Laurie, having got as far as
that&mdash;and not much farther&mdash;was sampling the fine inky
flavor of hers, and so chanced to look up and to let her glance
fall on her father.</p>
<p>At first she was only conscious that his expression was not
quite familiar to her.&nbsp; Then&mdash;well, then suddenly and
terribly, she saw that he was indeed changed&mdash;that something
frightful had happened to him.&nbsp; She sprang toward him,
calling his name.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;Father&mdash;father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no answer came.</p>
<p>The aunts came running, terror in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paralysis,&rdquo; said Miss Adnah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zillah,
call the doctor.&nbsp; Azalea, help me lay him down&mdash;yes, on
the floor.&nbsp; Open the window.&nbsp; Go get his bed ready,
Zillah, after you&rsquo;ve got the doctor.&nbsp; We and the
doctor between us must get him in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie did all she was told.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t
realize what had happened.&nbsp; Something seemed to be whirling
around and around in her brain, and all it said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Aunt Adnah wonderful?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
Aunt Adnah wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was indeed a general in times of trouble.&nbsp; Why, once
when she was young&mdash;but there isn&rsquo;t time to tell Aunt
Adnah&rsquo;s story now.</p>
<p>There was time for nothing, it seemed.&nbsp; It had come like
a lightning-flash.&nbsp; Even the doctor was unable to aid.&nbsp;
Simeon Pace lay in his bed, looking at them with tortured
eyes.&nbsp; It seemed to Annie Laurie that he was trying to make
her understand something&mdash;with all his vanishing power he
was trying to give her some important piece of information.&nbsp;
She put her ear to his <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>lips; she listened with the very
ears of her soul; but the thing he wished her to know went into
silence with him.&nbsp; A dread convulsion brought the end.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie, standing aghast, knew she was fatherless as well
as motherless.&nbsp; Yet it couldn&rsquo;t be!&nbsp; Why, only a
little while before everything had been well.&nbsp; Had been
well!&nbsp; That reminded her of the signal they were to
send&mdash;the signal that was to remind each member of the
Girl&rsquo;s Triple Alliance that they had not forgotten each
other.&nbsp; And they had agreed not to send the
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; message unless something very terrible
happened.&nbsp; They had laughed about it!&nbsp; And now the
terrible thing really had happened.&nbsp; Or had it?&nbsp; Was
it, perhaps, only a frightful dream?&nbsp; But no, it was
true&mdash;and her heart ached so!&nbsp; If only the girls
knew!&nbsp; Well, she would tell them.&nbsp; She sat near the
clock, watching it.&nbsp; Perhaps when she let the girls know,
her throat wouldn&rsquo;t ache so with that new, strange,
crushing pain.&nbsp; Perhaps her eyeballs would cease
burning.&nbsp; How busy it seemed around the house!&nbsp; People
were coming and going.&nbsp; They stopped to speak to her, and
she found herself saying mechanically:</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&nbsp; You are very kind.&nbsp;
To-morrow I&rsquo;ll understand better.&nbsp; Thank
you&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of sheer compassion they left her alone.</p>
<p>Seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It was time for the signal.&nbsp;
She found the lantern and made her way, unseen, to the
roof.&nbsp; Azalea&rsquo;s light shone at her from the gray air,
far, far up the ridge.&nbsp; Carin&rsquo;s light flashed from the
roof of the mansion.&nbsp; All was well with them.&nbsp; They
were laughing&mdash;Annie Laurie knew they were laughing.&nbsp;
And she&mdash;she waved her lantern up and down and up and down
with a kind of passion.&nbsp; She must make them know how deep
was the sorrow that had befallen her.&nbsp; And they seemed to
know.&nbsp; It was as if she could feel the streams of their
sympathy rolling toward her.&nbsp; Yes, they understood.&nbsp;
That queer fluttering of their lanterns assured her of it.&nbsp;
Annie Laurie left her roof and descending into the attic, sank on
an old settle there.&nbsp; She dragged a horse blanket over her
and at last the storm of her anguish broke, and she wept and
wept.</p>

128</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MYSTERY</span></h2>
<p>Was it a long time&mdash;weary hours and hours&mdash;before
Annie Laurie found her way down the stairs?&nbsp; She never could
be sure.&nbsp; A man, whom she did not at first recognize, was
leaving her father&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; For a second she felt like
rushing at him to tell him that he, a stranger, should not be in
there&mdash;in that sacred chamber where her father lay dead and
defenseless.&nbsp; Then she saw that it was Mr. Disbrow, the
undertaker, and realized what his task had been.&nbsp; He had
been making her father ready for his last resting place.</p>
<p>But surely the man was not ashamed of his task!&nbsp; He shot
one glance at Annie Laurie, and then without speaking, hastened
down the stairs and out of the front door.&nbsp; Was he sorry for
her and at a loss to say how sorry, and so had run away?&nbsp;
Annie Laurie could understand that.&nbsp; She would have felt
much the same way herself.&nbsp; Yet it was, she decided, an odd
way for a man to <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>feel who was so often in the house of mourning as an
undertaker naturally would be.&nbsp; However, it mattered
little.&nbsp; She was glad he hadn&rsquo;t spoken to her.&nbsp;
And yet, when she thought of him as Sam&rsquo;s father, it was
curious that he hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Of course it might be that he
knew nothing of the good friendship which existed between Sam and
herself, and he might not approve of it anyway.&nbsp; The
Disbrows were great for keeping to themselves.&nbsp; So were the
Paces, but the Paces were busy folk; they liked their neighbors
even if they didn&rsquo;t see much of them.&nbsp; But one always
had the feeling that the Disbrows shut themselves away from
society because they had something against it&mdash;nobody quite
knew what.&nbsp; Only Sam&mdash;Sam was different.&nbsp; He was
made to live in the world and to enjoy it.</p>
<p>A vision of him, wide-shouldered, brown-haired&mdash;his hair
would have curled a trifle if he had not continually discouraged
it&mdash;brown-eyed, smiling, frank, energetic, arose before
Annie Laurie.&nbsp; He had a ringing laugh, and the neighbors
said he dared to laugh even in that silent shut-up house where
his mother lay on her sofa, with mouse-like, cross-eyed Hannah
watching beside her.&nbsp; It came over Annie Laurie that <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>she had
disliked them for things that were none of their fault.&nbsp;
Mrs. Disbrow couldn&rsquo;t help being ill; Hannah couldn&rsquo;t
help being cross-eyed; and it was beautiful of her to be always
beside her mother.</p>
<p>Yet, as she paced the floor of her bedroom thinking about her
father, with her tortured thoughts leaping this way and that as
if they were struggling to escape from sorrow, a conviction came
over her that sickness often was the fault of the person who
suffered from it.&nbsp; She knew that an atmosphere of gloom hung
over Sam&rsquo;s house; that if he opened up the windows Hannah
was told to close them; if he brought in flowers they had to be
thrown out because they gave his mother a cold; if he built a
fire in the fireplace for cheerfulness, it was considered unsafe,
owing to a defect in the chimney.&nbsp; The stove was
sufficient&mdash;and indeed more than sufficient, since the
temperature of the room was at least eighty the winter
through.&nbsp; Poor Sam!&nbsp; Annie Laurie knew that he had
suggested that the chimney be mended so that they might sometimes
sit by the open fire, letting the raging stove subside; he had
urged Hannah to have an operation that would set her eyes
straight, <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>but the family had been too fearful of the
results.&nbsp; So they sat in gloom and hideousness within their
power to remedy.&nbsp; At least that was how it looked to
Sam&rsquo;s impatient, energetic nature, and Annie Laurie took
the same view.</p>
<p>Miss Zillah came in after a time, with arms and words of
comfort for her girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carin called up about seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she
said, after a time when Annie Laurie had wept out her grief on
her good aunt&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;She seemed to know
you were in trouble, though I don&rsquo;t understand how she
could have found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie told her of the signalling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she wanted to come right over to you, but I told
her to wait until to-morrow.&nbsp; Was I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get undressed now, poor one,&rdquo; soothed Aunt
Zillah.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, I&rsquo;ll open your bed and warm it
for you.&nbsp; Put on this flannel nightgown, that&rsquo;s a
dear.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll bring you a glass of milk&mdash;unless
you want something heartier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was wonderful, being petted like this.&nbsp; She had led a
chilly life, had Annie Laurie.&nbsp; She had known kindness, but
not, it must be confessed, warm love.&nbsp; Yet now Aunt
Zillah&rsquo;s <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>compassion and affection wrapped her about like a
cloak.&nbsp; How did the old song run?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come under my plaidie, the night&rsquo;s
gaun to fa&rsquo;;<br />
Come in frae the cauld blast, the drift and the snaw;<br />
Come under my plaidie and sit down beside me,<br />
There&rsquo;s room in&rsquo;t, dear lassie, believe me, for
twa.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, she would get in under Aunt Zillah&rsquo;s plaidie and
she would let the dear old lady know that she was grateful to her
for having asked her.&nbsp; So, when she had drunk the warm fresh
milk and been tucked in her bed, she put her arms around Aunt
Zillah&rsquo;s wrinkled neck and gave her a long, long hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never, never go back on each other, will
we?&rdquo; she whispered tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, lass, never,&rdquo; responded the old lady, the
tears dripping from her eyes on Annie Laurie&rsquo;s upturned
face.&nbsp; So, sweetened by a sorrow, which was after all but a
natural and right sorrow such as must come to all, Annie Laurie
sank into the dead sleep of grief.</p>
<p>The next few days were blurred and strange.&nbsp; Friends came
to the house.&nbsp; Flowers arrived in <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>boxes.&nbsp; There were many telephone messages.&nbsp;
The aunts were called up from the telegraph office.&nbsp; There
was business to do at the cemetery; arrangements to make at the
church.&nbsp; Through it all, Annie Laurie strove to do her
part.&nbsp; There would be time enough for grieving afterward,
she decided.&nbsp; The thing now was not to let too heavy a
burden fall on her aunts, who were, as Annie Laurie seemed to
discover for the first time, really getting to be old ladies.</p>
<p>But at last it all was over.&nbsp; The house was quiet and
peaceful.&nbsp; And the help on the farm came to Miss Adnah for
instructions.</p>
<p>It must have been three days after the funeral that Mr. Carson
called one afternoon and asked to see Annie Laurie and her
aunts.&nbsp; It was like him, in his thoughtfulness to include
her, Annie Laurie thought.&nbsp; She did not know that Charles
Carson, who liked almost everybody and who had the best will in
the world toward all mankind, nevertheless, knowing as much of
human nature as he did, thought it best to take her at once into
council concerning matters that would affect her future life.</p>
<p>He was received in the stiff little parlor, the two sisters
sitting opposite him in prim dignity, <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>and Annie Laurie instinctively
putting her chair near his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you will pardon me for speaking to you
concerning your affairs,&rdquo; he said in his hearty way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would not venture to do so uninvited, were it not a
matter that in a way concerns me also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Miss Adnah and Miss Zillah in
unison.&nbsp; Annie Laurie fixed her reddish-brown eyes upon him
with devotion, and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day before Mr. Pace died,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;I paid him twenty thousand dollars in cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie stared; the sisters started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to me foolish enough to pass such a sum of
money over in simple currency, but as you probably know, your
brother&rdquo;&mdash;he was now addressing himself to the elder
ladies&mdash;&ldquo;had a prejudice against banks.&nbsp; I wished
to give him my check.&nbsp; He said he had no use for
checks.&nbsp; He wanted money.&nbsp; It was a curious
idiosyncrasy of his, but since he wished it that way I humored
him.&nbsp; He put the roll of bills into his pocket&mdash;I paid
the money to him at Mr. Heller&rsquo;s bank&mdash;and drove away
with it.&nbsp; That was Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; He died
Sunday.&nbsp; I have <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>come to inquire&mdash;with only
neighborly motives, I beg you to believe&mdash;whether or not you
have seen anything of that roll of bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight pause.&nbsp; Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen nothing of it, sir,&rdquo; said Miss
Adnah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, sir,&rdquo; added Miss Zillah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and there must have been more money,&rdquo; broke
in Annie Laurie, &ldquo;much, much more!&nbsp; I know papa always
had a lot, Mr. Carson, but I haven&rsquo;t an idea where he kept
it.&nbsp; None of us had.&nbsp; If we ever asked him for money he
would go away for a time and presently come back with the bills
he meant to give us.&nbsp; He had some place where he hid it, and
I used to think he ought to tell some one of us where it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Carson
rather heatedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t any of you a
notion where he kept his funds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an earthly idea!&rdquo; cried Annie Laurie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t the faintest notion, sir,&rdquo; said
Miss Adnah.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will confess now that sister and I got
up in the night&mdash;last night it was&mdash;and looked
everywhere in his room.&nbsp; We even lifted the edges of the
carpet and took the back off the steel engravings.&nbsp; We
looked, of course, in the <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>bureau, and the chest and the
closet.&nbsp; We found nothing.&nbsp; It was our intention to
begin to-night searching in the other rooms of the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why in the night, ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Adnah looked rather offended, as if Mr. Carson had gone a
little too far in asking such questions.&nbsp; But Miss Zillah
broke out with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you see, sir, it seemed so silly and absurd for us
to have to do a thing like that.&nbsp; My opinion is that brother
Simeon should have kept up with the times and used a bank like
other men.&nbsp; I hate to have the neighbors know what trouble
and embarrassment he has put us to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Adnah looked at her sister in amazement.&nbsp; She, who
was so gentle of judgment and of speech, was actually criticising
a Pace&mdash;and her own dead brother at that!&nbsp; But Mr.
Carson turned a look of appreciation on the flushed little face
of the old lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Paces are not all cranks, anyway,&rdquo; was his
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Miss Zillah seems a very sensible sort
of a woman&mdash;quite fit to be related to Annie
Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reflection would have surprised Miss Adnah very much had
she known of it, for she regarded herself as a person of singular
good <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>sense.&nbsp; Indeed, she secretly thought that she had,
so far as the Paces were concerned, rather a monopoly of
it.&nbsp; Zillah she regarded as something of a dreamer, too
sentimental, or &ldquo;soft,&rdquo; as she put it, by half; and
she felt very disapproving when she heard her pass
uncomplimentary judgment upon one of the family.&nbsp; That was a
privilege which Miss Adnah reserved for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; Miss Zillah went on, blurting out
a family secret which Miss Adnah would have starved rather than
let anyone know, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t a cent in the
world.&nbsp; The small amount which my sister and I had in our
purses has been used up during the last few days.&nbsp; We owe
for all the expenses of our brother&rsquo;s funeral.&nbsp;
Really, I may say that we don&rsquo;t know which way to
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Zillah,&rdquo; responded Mr. Carson,
&ldquo;I will place a sum of money at your disposal
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why, Miss Adnah wondered, did he turn to Zillah instead of to
her?&nbsp; It seemed to her that it ought to be evident to anyone
that she was now the head of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; Mr. Carson went on, &ldquo;I will <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>deposit the
sum in the bank and send you the bank book.&nbsp; I know this
will be more in accord with your ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little twinkle in his eye as he said this, but
Miss Zillah did not catch it.&nbsp; She was really much flattered
that he should think her a person capable of conducting things in
a businesslike way, and she would not have shown by the flutter
of an eyelash how frightened she really was at the
suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Mr. Carson, &ldquo;our next
business will be to find that money.&nbsp; I propose that you
call in one or two trusty neighbors, not given to gossiping, and
that they assist you in looking over the premises.&nbsp; The
money must be here somewhere.&nbsp; It merely devolves on us to
find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Adnah made a gesture of distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe, sir,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;that you can have any notion of how intensely distressing
it is to us to do such a thing.&nbsp; And I may say that we have
no neighbors who wouldn&rsquo;t gossip.&nbsp; If you have any
such, please show them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie, who knew her Aunt Adnah&rsquo;s tempestuous
nature, saw that a storm was rising, and she cast about for a way
of diverting it.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&ldquo;Aunt Adnah,&rdquo; she broke in, &ldquo;let
Azalea and Carin help us hunt.&nbsp; You know if it&rsquo;s a
secret they&rsquo;ll never, never, tell it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
pledged ourselves to keep each other&rsquo;s secrets, you
see.&nbsp; And no one can look as hard as we girls can.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re like ferrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent idea, Miss Pace,&rdquo; said Mr. Carson,
nodding at Aunt Adnah.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the members of the Triple
Alliance have a hand at it.&nbsp; It will seem natural enough for
Annie Laurie&rsquo;s friends to be here with her in her trouble;
the girls will tell nothing; and their keen young wits are the
best ones imaginable to set at this task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon consultation it struck the sisters that this would be the
case.&nbsp; Bad as it would be to have three
&ldquo;young-ones&rdquo; ranging over their orderly house,
tearing up this and that, they would at least take the thing only
as a sort of game.&nbsp; They wouldn&rsquo;t be ill-natured and
sneering about it as their elders might be.</p>
<p>So it was agreed that they would accept Mr. Carson&rsquo;s
offer of a generous loan of money, and that on Saturday the three
girls were to start in under the direction of the Misses Pace,
and make a search of both house and yard.</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;Their eyes certainly are sharper than ours,
Adnah,&rdquo; Miss Zillah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; snapped Miss Adnah, worn and weary with the
difficulties of life, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re sharp enough.&nbsp;
Oh, Zillah, Zillah, why should we Paces be humiliated like
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No humiliation about it, sister,&rdquo; Miss Zillah
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take things a little easier, Adnah; let
some one help us out.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re very much
shaken&mdash;very much shaken, indeed.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re getting
old, and we&rsquo;ve had a great sorrow.&nbsp; If folks want to
help, why let &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no doubt about it, they were shaken.&nbsp; The
excitement and courage that had borne them up at first, failed
them as the week went on.&nbsp; Miss Adnah, who had felt herself
so able to attend to the business of the farm, not only found it
beyond her power to give an order, but she found it impossible to
fix her mind on the bookkeeping, which was a necessary part of
the business.&nbsp; Annie Laurie had been obliged to consult with
the help after her school hours, and to straighten out the
accounts as best she could during the evening.&nbsp; They felt
the need of a strong, quiet man of affairs&mdash;a good, reliable
overseer&mdash;but the men who were helping them were not <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>of that
sort, and they knew of no one in the country who seemed to meet
their need.</p>
<p>Saturday morning by nine o&rsquo;clock, according to Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s invitation, Azalea and Carin arrived on their
ponies.&nbsp; These being given to the stable men, the two girls,
in no little awe at entering a house of sorrow, came in to pay
their respects to Miss Zillah and her sister.&nbsp; The two sat
shivering before the fire, tearful and nervous, and even Miss
Adnah was now willing to give over the search for their lost
fortune into the hands of these respectful and sympathetic
girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first, my dear girls,&rdquo; said Aunt Zillah
brokenly, &ldquo;it seemed as if we couldn&rsquo;t let anyone in
to help us and it&rsquo;s hard enough now, but we&rsquo;d rather
it would be you than anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Zillah,&rdquo; cried Azalea in her impulsive
way, &ldquo;we understand just how you feel.&nbsp; But Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s fortune just must be found, mustn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s a quest, you know.&nbsp; A sacred
quest&mdash;like you read about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That glow which was Azalea&rsquo;s greatest charm, lit up her
dark face and Miss Zillah felt that here was a girl who was one
of them.&nbsp; She need fear nothing from her.&nbsp; As for that
sweet-faced Carson girl, with her golden hair and her <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>lovely
voice, how could anyone do anything but trust her?&nbsp; Yes, it
was all as it should be.&nbsp; They were old women and must give
their cares into the hands of others.</p>
<p>So the three girls began their never-to-be-forgotten search
for Annie Laurie&rsquo;s lost fortune.</p>
<p>Although the aunts had gone over the dead man&rsquo;s room,
they thought best to begin there.&nbsp; So thorough was their
search that they even ripped open the lining of his coats; they
looked in his shoes; they investigated his hat linings.&nbsp;
Nothing was found.</p>
<p>Then they searched the hallways, the pantries and
cupboards.&nbsp; They looked throughout the parlor, through the
living room, through the kitchen.&nbsp; They had one of the men
in to pull up the window sills.&nbsp; They took the bricks from
the hearth.&nbsp; Nightfall found them wearily searching the
dusty debris in the old attic.</p>
<p>Sunday was a day of rest for all of these people, but it was
very, very hard for them to sit in idleness while their
imaginations were rioting through the Pace property, searching
out every corner and cubbyhole for the lost money.&nbsp;
Naturally enough, Monday found the girls in no condition to
settle down to their studies, and as <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Mrs. Carson said, it was so much
more important that the money should be found than that they
should learn a lesson or two, that they were excused from school
and permitted to resume their search.</p>
<p>The yard was their point of attack this morning.&nbsp; They
looked over every inch of it, but nowhere did they see anything
save the hard, frozen surface.&nbsp; No hollow tree offered a
place for hiding.&nbsp; The solid substructure of the house
forbade them to hope for anything there.&nbsp; Next they went to
the barns, the stables and outhouses, but here the prospect was
discouraging indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie, &ldquo;when papa
wanted to get money for any purpose he always went to his own
room and locked the door.&nbsp; It seemed as if he must have kept
it with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can that be,&rdquo; argued Carin, dropping
white and worn into her chair&mdash;they were in Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s room,&mdash;&ldquo;when nothing has been found
anywhere about his clothes?&nbsp; Why, the only pocketbook he
appeared to have was that little one for silver.&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you ever see him with a large leather pocketbook,
Annie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;But now, when papa paid him that twenty thousand
dollars,&rdquo; Carin insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you suppose he
brought that home in his hand the way a child would a penny, or
rolled it up in his pocket where it could fall out any
minute?&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t seem reasonable; honestly it
doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, Azalea had a vision.&nbsp; She saw a man
come into a dark room&mdash;a room lighted only by a flickering
fire.&nbsp; She saw him lay aside his coat, unscrew his tin arm,
take something from the mantel shelf, place it within, then
replace the arm and the coat.&nbsp; She remembered how he had
asked her if she ever dreamed, and how she had said she never
told her dreams, and he had said that was right.&nbsp; And she
had remembered the look that had gone from him to her and back
again&mdash;a look which was a promise on her part not to tell
what she had seen and a message from him of confidence in
her.&nbsp; She sat rigid, going over the scene again before she
spoke.&nbsp; When she did the girls hardly recognized her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; she said&mdash;not very loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know?&rdquo;&nbsp; The others cried it
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kept his money in his tin arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him put some there once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night Annie Laurie and I fell asleep on the
sofa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more, &rsquo;Zalie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you
everything.&nbsp; Oh, Annie Laurie, was the tin arm buried with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It
was hanging on a nail in his bedroom the day after he was buried,
but the aunts couldn&rsquo;t bear to see it there and they
carried it to the attic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the money couldn&rsquo;t have been in it after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it might still be there.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to the attic they went, trembling with eagerness.&nbsp;
There, sure enough, from a beam hung the tin arm.&nbsp; Annie
Laurie could not quite bring herself to touch it.&nbsp; It seemed
almost like a part of her father.&nbsp; But Azalea took it down,
convinced that she was right.&nbsp; She looked into it; carried
it to one of the windows and looked <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>again.&nbsp; She ran her fingers
into the hand of it.&nbsp; She turned her disappointed face
toward her friends.&nbsp; There was nothing there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; she said with earnestness,
&ldquo;it <i>was</i> there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then some one has taken it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some
one has taken it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the aunts!&rdquo; cried Annie Laurie, fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mercy no,&rdquo; agreed Azalea, &ldquo;not the
aunts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who else handled the arm?&rdquo; asked Carin.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie stood thinking.&nbsp; Then a deep flush spread
over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;who else could have?&rdquo;
she stammered.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t bear to place anyone
under suspicion.</p>
<p>But Azalea was more impulsive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Mr. Disbrow, the undertaker, of course,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must have taken it off.&nbsp; He must
have&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped and the three stared at each
other.</p>
<p>And then Annie Laurie remembered how he had crowded by her in
the hall, not speaking, and looking the other way.</p>
<h2><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DISBROWS</span></h2>
<p>The three girls made up their minds to tell no one of their
suspicions concerning the disappearance of Simeon Pace&rsquo;s
money.&nbsp; But Azalea could not but talk it over with Pa
McBirney, and Thomas McBirney could not resist cogitating about
the matter with Haystack Thompson, and he, in turn, was impelled
to go with it to his trusted pastor, Absalom Summers.&nbsp; And
Absalom whispered it to his Barbara, and Barbara&mdash;but
perhaps she told no one.&nbsp; In looking the matter over
afterward, she was almost sure that she had told no one.&nbsp; At
least she hadn&rsquo;t told of it right out.&nbsp; And Carin
spoke of it only to her father; and he mentioned it merely to the
banker Heller, and he only spoke of it to his fellow officers in
the bank, and they told no one but their intimate friends.</p>
<p>As for Annie Laurie, she refrained with a mighty effort from
confiding her suspicions to her aunts, and she warned her friends
not to tell <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>them.&nbsp; Had they mulled that matter over and over
during the long, lonely winter evenings, the poor girl would have
felt as if she were losing her reason as well as her
fortune.&nbsp; Indeed, the winter had settled down heavily over
the Pace household.&nbsp; The dairy met with reverses.&nbsp; Two
of the best cows died.&nbsp; The accounts would not
balance.&nbsp; And worst of all, the helpers were hard to manage
and would not take orders willingly from Miss Adnah.&nbsp; The
strong will and hand of Simeon Pace were sorely missed.</p>
<p>And along with all this distress was the sense that Annie
Laurie and her aunts had of burning injustice.&nbsp; Somewhere in
the world was money in abundance, belonging to them.&nbsp; Just
how much it was they could not even guess.&nbsp; Of Mr.
Carson&rsquo;s purchase money of twenty thousand dollars they
felt sure.&nbsp; He had Simeon Pace&rsquo;s receipt to show for
that.&nbsp; But there was other money beyond question&mdash;the
savings of years.&nbsp; The old aunts, waking in the night, would
arise and fumble in the places in which they had looked so often;
and Annie Laurie, strong and sensible as she was, found that it
required all of her will to keep from following their
example.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>This
girl, so straightforward, so energetic and hopeful by nature,
found it almost intolerable to sit around, patient under
injustice.&nbsp; She proposed to Mr. Carson that he should go to
Hector Disbrow and accuse him of the theft of the
money&mdash;tell him the whole thing was known, and that he must
refund it or be arrested.&nbsp; But Mr. Carson shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, my dear,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the thing isn&rsquo;t known at all.&nbsp; It is only
surmised.&nbsp; Azalea, in semi-darkness, thought she saw your
father put something in his arm.&nbsp; She may have been
mistaken.&nbsp; Or even if she were not mistaken about his doing
so on that particular occasion, it doesn&rsquo;t in the least
follow that your father carried the money in question
there.&nbsp; Above all, it does not follow that it was in the arm
the day of his death; or that, even if it was there, that the
undertaker stole it.&nbsp; The tin arm must have hung in the room
for days.&nbsp; Many persons visited that room.&nbsp; Any one of
them might be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then is there nothing at all that can be done,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at present.&nbsp; I am watching
Disbrow&mdash;indeed, I may say the whole community has <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>him under
suspicion.&nbsp; If he is guilty be sure that sooner or later it
will come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here we are, getting deeper and deeper in debt to
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie Laurie, I am convinced that every cent I have
advanced you will be paid back to me in time.&nbsp; You are a
brave girl.&nbsp; I trust you completely.&nbsp; I feel that you
are going to make a success of life.&nbsp; Meantime, you are
living on borrowed capital.&nbsp; But so are thousands of
others.&nbsp; Back of it all, you must remember, is the fine farm
as security.&nbsp; It is a perfectly clear business
proposition.&nbsp; Have no fears, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She strengthened under the tone he used in speaking to
her.&nbsp; If he had pitied her, she would have broken down, but
he merely put it to her that she was playing her part in the
world, and she braced herself to play that part well and not
disappoint him or any of her other friends.</p>
<p>She tried to avoid Sam Disbrow, yet it seemed to be her luck
to meet him oftener than usual.&nbsp; He was very sorry for her,
she could see, and he assumed his brightest and heartiest manner
when he was with her, in his efforts to help her to be happy.</p>
<p>One day when there was a feeling of spring <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>in the air,
and she had gone along one of the little winding paths through
the pine wood, she met him with his gun on his shoulder and his
dogs at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Annie Laurie,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are you out
hunting too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep suspicion and anger she felt toward his father put
some irritation into her tone as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why are you hunting, Sam?&nbsp; I thought you were
working in the box factory office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so I was.&nbsp; You see, I had finished school
here and dad couldn&rsquo;t afford to send me away.&nbsp; I might
have gone anyway, and somehow worked my way through Rutherford
Academy, but Hannah said I oughtn&rsquo;t to leave mother.&nbsp;
So I stayed&mdash;though it didn&rsquo;t seem to me quite the
best thing to do.&nbsp; But now, suddenly, dad says I&rsquo;m to
go away to school.&nbsp; At first I refused.&nbsp; I was afraid
it would mean pinching and scrimping for all the rest of them at
home.&nbsp; But dad said, no, things were a little easier with
him now, and I&rsquo;d better take the chance while I had
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie stood before him in the path staring, while Sam
waited in vain for her congratulations.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;So, yesterday,&rdquo; he went on in a somewhat
dashed tone, &ldquo;a fellow came to the factory looking for
work.&nbsp; He said he needed it very badly&mdash;had his mother
to look after.&nbsp; So I spoke up and said I was leaving to go
into the Rutherford Academy at the spring term, and that
I&rsquo;d get out and let him have my place.&nbsp; You see, there
were a number of things I wanted to do around home before I went
away.&nbsp; And I was just crazy to get off in the hills for a
day or two.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way with us down here,
isn&rsquo;t it, Annie Laurie?&nbsp; We can keep under roof only
about so long.&nbsp; Then we have to go roving for a
spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie hardly heard what he said.&nbsp; She could with
difficulty keep from breaking out with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the money coming from that is to send you
away to the academy?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you ask your father how
he came by this money so suddenly?&nbsp; Have you no notion of
what he has done to earn this money?&nbsp; Can you be living a
lie&mdash;just as he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There swept back to her memory the words the minister had said
that day in church when she had caught Sam&rsquo;s eye, and had
known what he was thinking.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;Plant a lie in the garden of your soul,&rdquo;
he had said, &ldquo;and it will flourish worse than any poisonous
weed.&nbsp; Do not think you can uproot it when you will, for it
will grow and grow till it is stronger than you, and not all your
prayers and tears can rend its terrible roots out of your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam had wondered, as she had, why the preacher should have
talked like that to a congregation of good people.&nbsp; For they
had all seemed good to her; but now she realized that if the
Disbrows were living a lie perhaps other persons whom she knew
and liked were doing so, too.&nbsp; For the first time in Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s life a tidal wave of suspicion, distrust and
hatred of the world swept over her, and it seemed like a wicked
place&mdash;a place made up of beings who tried to injure each
other.</p>
<p>She felt so ill that she leaned against a tree.</p>
<p>Sam seemed to take no notice, however.&nbsp; He was watching
his dogs, and talking on and on in his cheerful way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another fine thing is going to happen,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dad has got up spunk enough at last to send
Hannah up to Williamsburg to have her eyes operated upon, and sis
has found the courage <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>to go.&nbsp; Do you know, I believe
that after she gets those poor eyes of hers straightened she
won&rsquo;t be so shy and queer as she is now.&nbsp; I suppose
she loathes going out where she&rsquo;ll meet people, when she
has to look all over the premises whenever she tries to fix her
eyes on the person she&rsquo;s talking to.&nbsp; Then, if dad
could only get some one in to take care of poor mother, Hannah
could go away to school too, perhaps, and grow to be a little
more like other folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie knew that Sam would not have talked about his own
people in this free way to anyone but her.&nbsp; The two had
spoken out their minds to each other for years, and it had come
to be second nature for them to do it.</p>
<p>And now here they were with a black secret between them.&nbsp;
She, Annie Laurie, who had meant always to be Sam&rsquo;s true
friend, was suspicious of him!&nbsp; Yet she could not look at
him, standing there smiling in the spring sunlight, his eyes full
of enthusiasm, and think him guilty of any knowledge of
wrong-doing on the part of his father.</p>
<p>How very, very strange life seemed!&nbsp; Once she had thought
it like a road.&nbsp; One had only to walk ahead, doing right and
nodding to the <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>passers-by, and all would be well.&nbsp; Now she saw
how it twisted, turned, and split&mdash;this road&mdash;and how
difficult it was to tell which turning to take, or which by-path
to seek.</p>
<p>Then an impulse came over her almost as strong and swift as
one of those which were forever besetting Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been in
your house for years.&nbsp; Do you know, I would like to
go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to go now.&nbsp; Do you think I
might?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam flushed a little and hesitated a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Annie, I don&rsquo;t know why you
shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Mother doesn&rsquo;t see many people, as
you know; and they won&rsquo;t be expecting you, but if
you&rsquo;ll take things as you find them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Sam,&rdquo; she aid dryly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I mean.&nbsp; I want to take them
as they are.&nbsp; I want to get acquainted with your
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked pleased and softened at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, Annie Laurie?&rdquo; he said with a little
thrill in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, that sure is nice of
you.&nbsp; Not very many of the neighbors seem to care whether
they live or die.&nbsp; Come along, then.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they turned in the direction of the Disbrow house, Annie
Laurie leading and Sam walking <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>behind, nervously smiling, the dogs
at his heels.</p>
<p>They turned in at the Disbrow place, passing through the
sagging gate, and Sam uttered his first apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried and tried to get that old gate to stay
up on the level,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But seems like we
never have the proper tools to do anything with; and anyhow, the
wood&rsquo;s so rotten it won&rsquo;t hold a nail,
hardly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a sagging gate is nothing,&rdquo; answered Annie
Laurie dully.</p>
<p>The little garden had not yet felt the influence of spring,
and it looked dejected enough.&nbsp; Fragments of last
year&rsquo;s mosquito netting dangled at the windows; the paint
of the little house was weather-worn; the arms were off the bench
on the porch.&nbsp; Green shades kept the light from making its
way into the low rooms.&nbsp; Indeed, so dim was the room into
which Annie Laurie stepped that at first she could see
nothing.&nbsp; The heat was fairly sweltering, and the atmosphere
was lifeless and stale-smelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Sam gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
brought a friend to see you&mdash;Annie Laurie Pace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; sighed a voice from the gloom, struggling
between reproachfulness and natural <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>politeness, &ldquo;have you?&nbsp;
How do you do, Annie Laurie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well, thank, you ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Are
you feeling any better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t seem to get any
better.&nbsp; Sam, you&rsquo;ll have to pull up a shade.&nbsp;
Annie Laurie won&rsquo;t be able to see a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie closed her eyes for an instant.&nbsp; She dreaded
what she would see, and yet she had long wished to know the
truth&mdash;to know what Sam&rsquo;s strange home was like.&nbsp;
She heard the shade being raised, and with something of an effort
she opened her eyes and looked about.&nbsp; What she saw gave her
a shock.&nbsp; Her own home was ugly enough, as she knew well;
but poverty was here, and worse than poverty&mdash;indifference
to appearances.&nbsp; The almost bare apartment wore that
dejected and unhappy aspect of a room for which no one cares and
in which no one hopes.&nbsp; It was a sad room&mdash;a sick
room&mdash;with a long couch and its occupant for the chief
objects.</p>
<p>Yes, the couch was long and wide, though the woman who lay on
it was so small.&nbsp; Figured brown calico covered the bed, and
the woman was dressed in a wrapper of faded blue.&nbsp; There <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>was no
collar about her throat&mdash;only the coarse open neck-band,
showing a shriveled neck.&nbsp; Her face was bloodless and
bleached like a vegetable that has grown in the dark, and out of
it looked a pair of weary eyes, beneath which were deep, dark
circles.&nbsp; Her hair&mdash;brown, touched with gray&mdash;was
brushed back straight and flat from her bulging brow, and this,
with her high-arched eyebrows, gave her an almost Chinese
look.&nbsp; Her hands, thinner and more apathetic than any hands
Annie Laurie ever had seen, lay on the calico cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very often I have light let in
here,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes my head ache
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie did not say that she ought not to have let it in
for her, if that was the case.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t really
feel that this was the case.&nbsp; She was glad the light was in
the room for once, and by it, she moved toward Mrs.
Disbrow&rsquo;s bed, her hand outstretched with something almost
like satisfaction, for she knew as she looked in that
woman&rsquo;s face, that if her fortune had been stolen from her
by the undertaker, his wife did not know it.&nbsp; She was as
convinced of this woman&rsquo;s innocence when she looked at her,
as she was of her pitiful condition.&nbsp; So she took one of the
<a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>claw-like hands in her own strong grasp and sat down
beside her.&nbsp; Mrs. Disbrow&rsquo;s face was quivering with
the excitement of meeting a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam often talks of you,&rdquo; said his mother in her
fluttering voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to see
you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a strong, fine girl, Annie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m strong and well,&rdquo; the girl
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t known a well day for
years,&rdquo; said the invalid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I lie, racked
with pain, and I declare I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s
one day or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie felt herself bracing against this discouraged
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you
really have to worry about what day it is.&nbsp; You have nothing
to do&mdash;no Monday washing to think of, or Saturday
baking.&nbsp; Some one else does all that for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke merely to present a cheerful side, but Mrs. Disbrow
flushed a trifle.&nbsp; Annie Laurie saw that she had said
something that annoyed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the sick woman replied still more
dejectedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothing but a drag on my
family.&nbsp; <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>I often say to them that it would be better if I was
out of their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose that makes them very
happy&mdash;hearing you say that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Annie Laurie
replied in her hearty way.&nbsp; It really seemed to her as if
that was the unkindest thing a mother could say to her
children.&nbsp; &ldquo;If only I could have my mother, sick or
well, or any way at all, I&rsquo;d be the happiest girl in the
world.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s terribly lonely being without a
mother&mdash;or a father,&rdquo; she added almost in a
whisper.</p>
<p>Mrs. Disbrow reached out her hand and laid it on Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl,&rdquo; she murmured with what was almost her
first thought of anyone save herself, that winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;Oh, I feel so sorry for Sam and Hannah, with
you ill always,&rdquo; went on Annie Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course it spoils their happiness.&nbsp; It seems such a
pity!&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t there anything that can be done, Mrs.
Disbrow?&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t any doctor know how to cure
you?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you any idea yourself of what ought to
be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my husband talks of going West soon,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Disbrow with something like vivacity&mdash;or
rather, like a shadow of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>looking
forward to that.&nbsp; If we could get to a new place and to a
new house, and if there was something to look forward to, and
hope for the children to make something of themselves, I
don&rsquo;t know&mdash;maybe&mdash;&rdquo; her voice trailed off
and her eyes fixed themselves in an aimless reverie on the
opposite wall.</p>
<p>So they were going West!&nbsp; That was the plan.&nbsp; The
man who had been unable to give his family a chance, who had been
broken by this long illness of his wife&rsquo;s, who had failed
to make his place among men, was going West.&nbsp; His chance had
come to him at last.&nbsp; Had it come through theft?&nbsp; Annie
Laurie found herself wishing that they might indeed have the
chance, these poor people who seemed never to have been able to
step out into the sunshine.&nbsp; Yet had they a right to this
chance&mdash;if it meant her defeat?&nbsp; Could she let them go
this way, while she was left to struggle with poverty?</p>
<p>The door opened and a girl entered.&nbsp; Hannah!&nbsp; She
was so slender that Annie Laurie, who was broad of shoulder, with
a backbone that might have been made of steel, wondered how the
poor thing managed to keep upright.&nbsp; Her face was
ivory-colored, her frock an ill-fitting <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>gingham of
a hideous &ldquo;watermelon&rdquo; pink.&nbsp; She turned her
dreadfully crossed eyes on Annie Laurie&mdash;or to be correct,
turned one of them on her&mdash;and looked at her
resentfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is sister Hannah, Annie Laurie,&rdquo; said Sam in
rather a stifled voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You two girls ought to know
each other, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said Hannah, miserable with
shyness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m pretty well, thank you, Hannah,&rdquo;
Annie Laurie answered, and then she added: &ldquo;But I
can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m very happy.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t
expect that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very, very lonely without my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had risen and stood before the girl, with her bald little
statement of sorrow, and Hannah, forgetting herself and her fears
for a moment, looked up at Annie Laurie with sympathy in her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too bad.&nbsp;
I&mdash;I cried after I heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed astonished at herself for saying so much, and Sam
looked at her with amazement.&nbsp; Had Hannah actually cried
over some one else&rsquo;s troubles?</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; exclaimed Annie Laurie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, that was sweet of you, Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She forgot her Aunt Adnah&rsquo;s axiom that the Paces seldom
kissed, and leaned forward and planted a warm kiss on
Hannah&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to know that,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see I feel so&mdash;so friendless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, with your aunts and all?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Disbrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I ought to be protecting my aunts, you
see,&rdquo; explained Annie.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are old and
terribly broken by father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; And then,
everything has gone so wrong with us.&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t been
able to find father&rsquo;s money anywhere, you know, and
we&rsquo;re really poor.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve no money to run the
dairy on, and the men need overseeing, and I&rsquo;ve blundered
along with my bad bookkeeping.&nbsp; Altogether, it looks as if
things were going to ruin, and I just can&rsquo;t bear that, Mrs.
Disbrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve always been so prosperous!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Disbrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;My husband often has spoken
of how prosperous your father was, and has contrasted him with
himself.&nbsp; You see, Mr. Disbrow never has got on well
here.&nbsp; His farm has paid poorly, and of course <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>the
undertaking business is of very little consequence in a community
like this.&nbsp; I declare I can&rsquo;t blame him for being
discouraged and bitter and sort of half-hating the men who are
successful.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to like people when everything
is going against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie swept her glance around the room again, taking in
the brother and sister, and resting it at last on the sick
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; she said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose it is.&nbsp; But Mrs. McBirney says you have to give out
liking to have people like you, and that you have to think you
are going to succeed in order to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have to think well in order to be well, I
suppose,&rdquo; said the invalid angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose
that&rsquo;s her idea.&nbsp; Well, you can tell her for me that
she&rsquo;s mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie did not look rebuked.&nbsp; She sat still,
thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know so little about sickness,&rdquo; she said
slowly,&nbsp; &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t even sympathize the way I
ought to, I suppose.&nbsp; Oh, Mrs. Disbrow, don&rsquo;t you
suppose you could go riding with me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m such a good
driver, I wouldn&rsquo;t let you be shaken <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>up at
all.&nbsp; Sam and Hannah could sit beside you to keep you from
being joggled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty sight I&rsquo;d make!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Disbrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too many of the neighbors
would be peeking out to see what I looked like, after all these
years of being shut away.&nbsp; No, thank you, child, I
don&rsquo;t believe I want to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you could go at twilight.&nbsp; We could go when
the neighbors are at supper.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun,
Sam?&nbsp; Could you sit up, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe I could.&nbsp; And even if I
did, like as not I&rsquo;d pay for it the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not try?&nbsp; Maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t have to
pay for it.&nbsp; Oh, ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s so wonderful to be
out of doors.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t think what you miss staying
in here&mdash;can she, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t have an
idea.&nbsp; Oh, mother, you never would listen to me, though
truly I believe you&rsquo;d be ever so much better if you would
get out.&nbsp; Please try.&nbsp; The three of us will be able to
take good care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and then the boy flung out
his arms with sudden passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, mother, please try!&nbsp; Why need we all
be so unhappy?&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t we have a little joy like
other people?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Annie
Laurie felt the tears leap into her eyes.&nbsp; She had never
before seen Sam as other than the cheerful, hearty boy, but now
she knew that the cheerfulness and heartiness had been an
imitation of the real thing.&nbsp; They had been but his courage
masquerading as something else.</p>
<p>Mrs. Disbrow raised herself on her elbow and looked at her
son.&nbsp; Suddenly a great light broke over her.&nbsp; She had
not been the only sufferer in that house.&nbsp; Before her were
the two whose youth she had shadowed with her pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; she said in a strange
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;When shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried Annie Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
run right home and have the men hitch up.&nbsp; Oh, Hannah, be
sure she&rsquo;s dressed warm enough.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have
something warm put in for her feet.&nbsp; Oh, Sam, maybe
she&rsquo;ll like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned toward the boy with outstretched hands and he
caught and held them for a moment.&nbsp; Then she was off,
running as fast as she could to serve the people into whose house
she had gone with the motives of a spy.</p>

<p>Of course Annie Laurie told Azalea and Carin all about it as
the three sat together the next day after luncheon, in the
schoolroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa said he&rsquo;d seen you,&rdquo; Carin
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was horseback riding and late getting
home, and he said he saw you out with the Disbrows, and that Mrs.
Disbrow looked like a ghost that had got back to earth and
didn&rsquo;t like it very well.&nbsp; But he thought you were
wonderful to do that.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t quite see how you
could, feeling as you do, but he thought it lovely of you just
the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see I
didn&rsquo;t feel quite the way I thought I did when I saw that
poor woman and Hannah; and then poor Sam looked at me as if he
thought I could set his world right if I only would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terribly twisted world,&rdquo; mused
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, what if poor little Hannah has her eyes
straightened, and Sam goes to college, and Mrs. <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Disbrow
gets her health out West all out of the money that was stolen
from you, Annie Laurie?&nbsp; Those are all good things to have
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are,&rdquo; answered Annie Laurie without
anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are good things.&nbsp; But you remember
what Elder Mills said that last night about avoiding lies in word
and act.&nbsp; I remember particularly because it was something
like what the preacher had been saying over to the Baptist church
only a few Sundays before.&nbsp; It seemed to me they were all
harping on that subject, but I begin to see why, now.&nbsp; I can
see that all false things are lies&mdash;that stealing is a sort
of lie&mdash;a saying that something is yours which
isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It will be like that with the Disbrows, I
suppose; no matter what good comes to them, it won&rsquo;t seem
good&mdash;at least not to Mr. Disbrow, who knows the truth about
how he came by the money.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s dreadful, when you
come to think of it, that a nice boy like Sam should be having
things out of that money he&rsquo;s no right to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to speak as if it was an absolutely
sure thing that he took the money, Annie Laurie,&rdquo; warned
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Papa says we mustn&rsquo;t do that.&nbsp; He
says it&rsquo;s a kind of crime in itself <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>to accuse
people of sins when you&rsquo;re not sure they&rsquo;re
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to,&rdquo; sighed Annie Laurie
penitently, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s very hard.&nbsp; And, oh,
Carin, it&rsquo;s getting to be so sad at the house with the old
aunts always talking about the lost money and hunting and hunting
for it, and the business going to pieces and I not able to
prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night when the Carsons sat at dinner, Carin told her
father that Annie Laurie had said Mrs. Disbrow was expecting her
husband to take the family West.</p>
<p>Mr. Carson brought his fist down on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have that!&nbsp; I simply won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
No matter what risk I run of doing the man an injustice, I
won&rsquo;t have him leave this community.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s under
suspicion and he&rsquo;s got to stay here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry
for him, sometimes, when I see him walk into town and all the men
turn their backs on him and walk away.&nbsp; Of course, it
isn&rsquo;t really fair&mdash;or at least, it may not be fair,
for it is possible that he is as innocent as you or I.&nbsp; But
if he is guilty, he&rsquo;s getting only a small part of what he
deserves.&nbsp; At any rate, I can understand that he&rsquo;s
very uncomfortable in this town nowadays, and <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>that
he&rsquo;d like mighty well to get out of it.&nbsp; But he
shan&rsquo;t, if I have anything to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, however, Annie Laurie came with startling
news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo; she cried as she dashed into
the schoolroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; the girls asked in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Disbrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they have.&nbsp; I was walking along the road and
I happened to look over toward their house, and there
wasn&rsquo;t any smoke coming from the chimney.&nbsp; And there
was something about the place&mdash;I can&rsquo;t describe it,
because the curtains are forever down anyway&mdash;but something
that looked deserted.&nbsp; So I pelted across the field and
knocked at the door and no one answered.&nbsp; And then I tried
the door and it was locked.&nbsp; I saw the chickens were gone,
too, and the cow and the horses.&nbsp; They all went in the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think Sam would let his family act like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam went to Rutherford yesterday to the academy.&nbsp;
No, I don&rsquo;t think he knew a thing about it.&nbsp; He came
over after I got home from school to say good-bye, and he was
very happy <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>and&mdash;oh, well&mdash;good, you know.&nbsp; No one
could have looked as he did if he had thought his father was a
thief and his family sneaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my goodness,&rdquo; exclaimed Azalea,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you suppose he&rsquo;s noticed how the men
were treating his father&mdash;turning their backs on him and all
that?&nbsp; Pa McBirney said he just couldn&rsquo;t bring himself
to shake hands with him any more.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you suppose
Mr. Disbrow ever had spoken of that at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always was bitter and fault-finding anyway,&rdquo;
said Annie Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Disbrow told me that.&nbsp;
I suppose a little more or less complaining wouldn&rsquo;t mean
anything to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she certainly must have wondered at having the
house torn up in an hour or two, and at setting out in the night
that way like fugitives,&rdquo; said Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know she hated to go out driving with me
for fear the neighbors would be peeping at her, so I suppose she
was well pleased to go in the night.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d hate to
have folks find out what a poor little handful of things they
had, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Azalea, &ldquo;it would be easy
enough to find which way they went, by the <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>wagon
marks.&nbsp; They must have had the cow tied on behind the wagon,
and so they could be followed easily and overtaken if&mdash;if
you wanted them to be, Annie Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;I know.&nbsp; If&mdash;I wanted them to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sank into a chair and rested her face in her hand,
staring straight before her.&nbsp; Azalea and Carin said
nothing.&nbsp; They were thinking very, very hard, too.&nbsp; The
silence was long and intense.&nbsp; Then they heard Miss
Parkhurst&rsquo;s steps approaching down the hall.&nbsp; Annie
Laurie struck her two hands together sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t let Sam&rsquo;s people be chased like that and
brought back.&nbsp; I may be wrong, and weak, and not fair to the
poor old aunts, but I just can&rsquo;t do it, that&rsquo;s all
there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin and Azalea looked at her with perfect understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carin softly, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t
do that, could you?&nbsp; Plenty of people could, and
they&rsquo;d be just and right&mdash;maybe.&nbsp; But you
couldn&rsquo;t, and I like you, Annie Laurie, because you
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; she agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will all
come right for you, Annie.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what dear Ma <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>McBirney
would say if she knew.&nbsp; Somehow it will all come
right.&nbsp; But to have that poor, sneaking, miserable man
chased, and that sick woman, and little Hannah who is
half-frightened out of her life anyway&mdash;oo-oo-oo!&nbsp; You
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Parkhurst opened the door.&nbsp; The three girls arose
respectfully and answered her good morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Algebra this morning,&rdquo; she said briskly.&nbsp;
Perforce they turned their thoughts to matters that were anything
but exciting.</p>
<p>But if they could have known the experiences their friend Sam
Disbrow was going through, their lesson would have been even
poorer than it was&mdash;and Miss Parkhurst had already been
obliged to tell them that as mathematicians she did not consider
them brilliantly successful.</p>
<p>Sam had set off with a light heart.&nbsp; For the first time
in his life he was going away from home&mdash;that depressing and
melancholy home, against the gloom of which he had set all the
forces of his really happy and brave nature.&nbsp; But the home
had been too much for him.&nbsp; He could feel it slowly and
surely dragging him down into that pit of gloom and distrust
where the others lived, and to leave it behind, to have <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>a chance to
go to school and get the education which he felt he must have if
he was to make anything of himself, filled him not only with joy
but gratitude.</p>
<p>Of course, he still wondered how his father had been able to
manage it.&nbsp; He knew that they were very poor&mdash;that his
father had not been able to make a success at anything.&nbsp; His
garden never flourished like that of his neighbors; his chickens
never laid well; his cow gave only a fraction of the milk she
should; his cotton was but a scanty crop; and even as an
undertaker, the only one in Lee, he sometimes was passed over for
his remote rival in Rutherford.</p>
<p>Recently things had been going even more wrong than
usual.&nbsp; Sam could not explain it, but a general dislike of
the whole Disbrow family seemed to have invaded the town.&nbsp;
His father never had been popular, but lately Sam had noticed
signs of actual aversion.&nbsp; How was it to be accounted
for?&nbsp; If ever the faintest shadow of an idea as to the real
reason for this dislike entered Sam&rsquo;s mind, he thrust it
out, strangled and unrecognizable, from his consciousness.&nbsp;
He believed in his father because he believed in himself.&nbsp;
He was not a person to whom <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>suspicion came naturally, although
he had lived in the midst of it all his days.&nbsp; There is a
thing called reaction&mdash;the sharp turning of the spirit
against a condition or an idea.&nbsp; Sam had reacted against the
gray dispositions in his family.&nbsp; He was ready to blossom
into the scarlet of courage and good will, of power and joy, if
only a little sun could shine on him.</p>
<p>And now it seemed to be shining.&nbsp; He was going away to
school as other boys did.&nbsp; There would be a number of
fellows he knew, and chief among them would be Richard Heller,
the banker&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; He liked Heller.&nbsp; He counted
on him to &ldquo;show him the ropes&rdquo; at the academy.</p>
<p>It was a long time since he had been in the smart town of
Rutherford.&nbsp; His heart leaped in him as he stepped out from
the station, his bag in his hand, and felt the throb of the busy
town about him.&nbsp; Automobiles were ranged in line about the
station, carriages with well-kept horses stood in the shade
beneath the fine elms, the paved streets were clean, the street
cars new and fresh looking, and everywhere were busy, active
people, moving along with that air of confidence and efficiency
which too often was lacking at Lee.&nbsp; And it exhilarated
Sam.&nbsp; All that was <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>strong and eager in him liked
it.&nbsp; He wanted to be a part of a community like that.</p>
<p>He took the street car that ran to the academy, and sat wrapt
in interest at noting the fine homes, the well-kept lawns, the
excellent public buildings.&nbsp; People were doing things here
that were worth while, said Sam to himself.&nbsp; And he, in his
way, was going to be a part of it.&nbsp; Perhaps he could stay in
the Academy till he was graduated&mdash;with honors,
maybe&mdash;and then he would stay on at Rutherford, and become a
part of its busy, stirring life.&nbsp; He would have a home like
the one he was passing, with tall windows, and the light
streaming in through beautiful trees, and a porch like that, with
his family sitting out on it in the open, and not hiding away in
the shadow.&nbsp; Then there would be bright flowers, like those
in that yard, and friends coming and going the way they were from
that house.&nbsp; And they would be laughing&mdash;Annie Laurie
loved to laugh&mdash;and sometimes they would eat on the
lawn.&nbsp; But he drew himself up with a flush.&nbsp; What had
Annie Laurie to do with it all?&nbsp; A girl like
that&mdash;would she care seriously for one of the queer,
shiftless tribe of Disbrow?&nbsp; Sam <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>hit his knee angrily.&nbsp; Let him
attend to what was before him and stop thinking nonsense.</p>
<p>He reached the Academy, and walked along under its wonderful
white oaks to the Ballenger dormitories, where he knew Heller
stayed.&nbsp; Perhaps Heller could get him a room near his
own.&nbsp; It was rather a trick to get in the Ballenger
dormitories and the fellows who succeeded were considered
lucky.&nbsp; But perhaps Heller could manage it for him
somehow&mdash;they always had been good friends.</p>
<p>He was directed along the corridors, hung with their many
pictures, and decorated with plaster casts, to a corner room on
the third story.</p>
<p>He knocked expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; commanded Heller&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Sam threw open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come on to
school.&nbsp; What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped his suit case and hastened toward Richard with
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>Dick took it silently.&nbsp; His eyes, that used to be so
cordial in their glances, turned upon Sam with a scrutinizing
look.&nbsp; They searched his drooping face sharply.&nbsp; Then
something like the old expression returned.&nbsp; Sam was not
slow.&nbsp; <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>He saw that something was quite wrong&mdash;that Dick
had been thinking evil of him in some way, and that now that he
had met him face to face, he was finding it difficult to sustain
the suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, man?&rdquo; Sam cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are you looking at me like that for?&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; answered Dick brusquely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Something is the matter, Sam, but I&rsquo;d rather be
skinned than tell you what it is.&nbsp; All the same I&rsquo;m
not going to go around snubbing you and leaving you in the dark
after all the good times we&rsquo;ve had together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not, indeed,&rdquo; cried Sam.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Skin away, old man.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have the operation
over with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, it was evident, dared not give himself time to
think.&nbsp; He blurted out what he had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dad wrote me that you were thinking of coming down
here to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and he said the neighbors all were wondering
where in the dickens your father got the money to send
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Sam angrily,
&ldquo;that it is any of their blamed business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It mightn&rsquo;t be under some circumstances,&rdquo;
Dick went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where the skinning process comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rip ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they think it mighty queer, you know, that your dad
should come into money just at the time that Simeon Pace&rsquo;s
money disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam was on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; went on Dick, gulping with distress,
yet determined to finish the whole story then and there,
&ldquo;that Simeon Pace carried his money in his hollow tin arm,
and that your father took that arm from Simeon Pace&rsquo;s body,
and helped himself to the money.&nbsp; Now, there you are,
and&mdash;dang it, Sam,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to try to forgive
me for telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam sank into his seat again and sat staring.&nbsp; The little
clock on the mantel shelf ticked off the seconds
briskly&mdash;ticked on and on, and still Sam sat and stared, and
Dick waited, hardly daring to breathe.&nbsp; He could see that
Sam was <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>going over the whole situation&mdash;was balancing this
against that, thinking over the things he had noticed,
&ldquo;sizing up&rdquo; the situation with his good clear
brain.</p>
<p>Suddenly he got up and seized his suit case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; shouted Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; said Sam quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick ran forward and, grasping Sam&rsquo;s hand, wrung it with
all his strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;How I wish it
could have been otherwise!&nbsp; But I had to tell you.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t let a thing like that lie between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
got to be cleared up.&nbsp; Living a lie!&nbsp; I remember a
sermon&mdash;Annie Laurie and I heard it&mdash;living a
lie!&nbsp; No, I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Good-bye, Dick.&nbsp;
It&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t for me, was it?&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked
about the charming room, and through the window at the great
campus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye.&nbsp; And&mdash;thank you.&nbsp;
You did right.&nbsp; It was the only thing to do, since we were
such old&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; cried Dick with a half-sob.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Such old friends, Sam.&nbsp; Yes, go home and clear it
up.&nbsp; And come back, old man&mdash;whatever you do, come
back!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MARCHING ORDERS</span></h2>
<p>Sam saw nothing now of the inviting homes and their lovely
gardens as he rode back to the station.&nbsp; The world seemed
black shot through with little darts of scarlet.&nbsp; They kept
teasing him&mdash;these darting flecks of red, sharp-pointed and
angry.&nbsp; At the station he found that it was an hour and a
half before train time, so he sat down stolidly to wait.&nbsp; He
had missed his luncheon, and it was now near dinner time, but it
did not occur to him to get anything to eat.</p>
<p>The time, too, raced by, keeping pace with those
swift-speeding thoughts of his, on which he could not have drawn
the reins had he tried.&nbsp; And presently he was on the train
again, going homeward.&nbsp; He soon would see his father, who
would not, Sam had to confess with biting shame, look him in the
eye nor answer any question frankly.&nbsp; Moreover, it would be
his fate to add to his mother&rsquo;s misery; he would see Hannah
turning away from him even more than <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>she had.&nbsp; And all the town
would be looking at him with the eyes of suspicion.&nbsp; He
would read: &ldquo;Son of a thief!&nbsp; Son of a thief!&rdquo;
in their averted glances.</p>
<p>Of course his father might not be guilty.&nbsp; And yet,
somehow, shamefully, heart-breakingly, it was borne in upon him
that he was.&nbsp; And why should he, Sam, who had done no harm
to anyone, go back to face it?&nbsp; Why should Annie Laurie and
her friends see his shame?&nbsp; He could disappear
now&mdash;slip off the train at the next station&mdash;and walk
and walk till he reached some place where nobody knew him, and
then he could go to work and care for himself, and win an
honorable name.&nbsp; That was what America was for, he had heard
Mr. Carson say, to give a chance to the individual.&nbsp; A man
had a right to prove himself, and to be judged by himself, apart
from and regardless of his family.</p>
<p>Yet, to run away from a thing like that, to let the old
neighbors think him a poor wretch, to lose the regard of&mdash;of
all those he cared about, was out of the question.&nbsp; And
moreover, he couldn&rsquo;t let his father go on keeping back the
fortune that belonged to others.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d have to go back
and make him right himself.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>His
thoughts came clashing together as a returning wave meets and
breaks against an advancing one upon the seashore.&nbsp; And the
tumult and raging was too much for him.&nbsp; He found himself
incapable of going on just then.&nbsp; The train stopped for a
moment at some woodland siding&mdash;the track was but a single
one and such stops were occasionally necessary&mdash;and almost
without thinking, Sam leaped from the platform and slipped away
into the twilight.</p>
<p>He walked along, hardly knowing where he was going.&nbsp; His
suit case was not much of a handicap, for there was little enough
in it.&nbsp; He could not have told, if any one had asked him,
why he kept on pounding along the road, nor why, when he came to
a heavily wooded hill, he should have gone in through an opening
in the trees and begun to climb its gentle slope.&nbsp; He only
knew that he was grateful to have the trees closing around him
like that, hiding him from the sight of men.</p>
<p>He went on, stumbling over roots, half-starting at deep
shadows, and reached the summit.&nbsp; Here the trees had been
cut away, and though the songs of those beneath him surged up to
his ears, he presently found himself standing <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>beneath the
clear sky, perfectly sheltered from view.&nbsp; There was a
scythe-like young moon, well toward the zenith, and a few pale
stars.&nbsp; The weather had softened and warmed and spring was
sending her sweet messages abroad.&nbsp; He stood for a moment
looking upward; then he cast himself on the ground, with his face
to the earth, and in the solitude his sharp suffering gave vent
to itself in sobs.</p>
<p>Nor was it alone for the shame and sorrow of the present that
he wept.&nbsp; It seemed as if all the tears he had held back
during his lonely and baffled boyhood had their way now and
streamed from his eyes.&nbsp; He cried blindly,
passionately.&nbsp; He emptied his soul of grief.&nbsp; And then
he sat up weakly and looked around him.&nbsp; The whippoorwills
were calling to each other.&nbsp; Distant hounds were
barking.&nbsp; The delicate little moon was running her fragile
skiff over the sky-sea toward its western port.&nbsp; It was
night, and the world was asleep.&nbsp; What was it Annie Laurie
sang?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All are sleeping, weary heart.<br />
Thou, thou only sleepless art.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He hoped she was sleeping&mdash;that poor Annie Laurie, who
was having so much trouble, and <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>none of it in any way her
fault.&nbsp; And had she, too, been suspecting him?&nbsp; Had she
held this terrible idea of his father and kept it to
herself?&nbsp; Had she come to his house that day she had been so
kind and good, to see what they were like&mdash;the
Disbrows?&nbsp; He seemed to be on fire from head to foot with
shame.&nbsp; Back and forth, like wild beasts pacing, raged his
thoughts.&nbsp; He had no idea of the passage of time.&nbsp; Only
the stars kept moving on, beautifully, in their wonderful order,
and the wind, growing chillier now, blew upon him, and still the
whippoorwills called.&nbsp; By and by the color of the world
began to change.&nbsp; Something strange happened to the
night&mdash;it grew pale, thin, transparent.&nbsp; The birds
began stirring about, making soft noises.&nbsp; The cattle lowed
in the near-by fields.&nbsp; Then a kind of milky lightness,
delicate as one of Carin&rsquo;s scarfs, drifted up into the
sky.&nbsp; Presently it turned a soft pink; then rosy red; then
it was edged with orange and embroidered with saffron.&nbsp; It
was sunup, and Sam Disbrow faced the most important day of his
life.</p>
<p>He had to make up his mind whether he was a coward or a brave
man&mdash;whether he was going to run away or stay and
fight.&nbsp; And he didn&rsquo;t <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>know.&nbsp; As he got dizzily to his
feet, he hadn&rsquo;t an idea which he was.&nbsp; But the colors
in the sky seemed to be cheering him on like trumpets.&nbsp;
Something wild, strange and splendid swept into his
spirit&mdash;something that made him feel as if he were about to
set out on a march with brave men&mdash;men who could die for an
idea.&nbsp; It was as if he had swung into the ranks, and his
leader had shouted &ldquo;Forward, march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam went down the hill, and struck a road on the far side of
it.&nbsp; He followed it to a farmhouse and asked if he might
have some breakfast.&nbsp; They gave him good bacon and corn
bread, butter and milk.&nbsp; He ate like one famished, and then,
having learned the schedule of the trains, and that he had barely
time to catch the next one bound toward Lee, he ran as hard as he
could to the distant station.&nbsp; The train drew in while he
was yet a block away, but he sent out a shout that startled the
engineer in his cab.&nbsp; Good-naturedly, they held the train
for him.&nbsp; He swung on the rear platform.&nbsp; And, though
he could not forget for a moment all that he was going back to,
still he was indefinably happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, march,&rdquo; his invisible leader had
commanded.&nbsp; Sam did not stop to find a name <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>for this
leader&mdash;to call him God.&nbsp; He obeyed, and having placed
himself under marching orders, he fell asleep, and when the
conductor called him at Lee, arose refreshed, and went out to
fight his battle.</p>
<p>There were not many persons on the street.&nbsp; A
mid-forenoon quietude rested over the little town.&nbsp; A few
neighbors Sam did meet, but they had no chance to turn the cold
shoulder to him this morning for he hardly saw them.&nbsp; He was
bent for home, and he strode forward with no thought of anything
but meeting his father face to face and hurling at him the
question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you take Simeon Pace&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He forgot that he was a son, and must pay a son&rsquo;s
deference, or that Hector Disbrow, suspected of being a thief,
was his father.&nbsp; He felt as if his soul must put that
inquiry to the soul of the man.&nbsp; And on his answer depended
honor, happiness, everything.</p>
<p>As he drew near the house, he saw that there was something
unusual about it.&nbsp; With a sick feeling, he realized that it
looked even more vacant and dejected than ordinarily.&nbsp; He
tried the front door; found it locked; sped to the rear; was
unable to enter; and then, rushing to the <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>stable,
realized the whole truth.&nbsp; His family had gone.&nbsp; They
had run away in the night.&nbsp; The whole thing was true.&nbsp;
His father was a thief&mdash;and now he was making of himself a
fugitive.</p>
<p>But the feeling of having come back to fight a battle as a
brave man would fight it, did not desert him.&nbsp; The black
despair of the night before had been routed by all the better
angels of his nature.&nbsp; He was in the thick of the battle
now, beyond question.&nbsp; He turned his back on the house and
went toward the town.</p>
<p>On his way, he met Hi Kitchell, who had been excused from
school because of a toothache, and who was running along, his
hand to his face, quite willing to talk about his misery to
anyone.&nbsp; Sam called him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hi.&nbsp; Toothache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you going home for?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you go
to a dentist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use in that.&nbsp; Turn around the other way.&nbsp;
Come on down to the dentist&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi wriggled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;Will yeh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I will.&nbsp; And Hi, I&rsquo;ve got a trouble
that&rsquo;s much worse than toothache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you, Sam&mdash;for sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For sure I have, Hi.&nbsp; Now if you had a terrible
trouble what would you do?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told you where to go
to get a toothache cured, but where would you go if&mdash;if
everything you cared for seemed tumbling to pieces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi came up close to Sam.&nbsp; He had forgotten about his
toothache, and he looked at Sam with his ferret eyes, in which
the tears had now gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; he said under his breath, &ldquo;I know
about your trouble.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard of it.&nbsp;
And&mdash;and you know your people have gone away.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve gone over the mountain, I reckon.&nbsp; Why, Sam,
if I was in trouble like that I&rsquo;d go straight to Mr.
Summers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s the Methodist preacher, you know, and my
folks are Baptists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo; cried Hi
defiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see no difference.&nbsp;
Anyway, if Mr. Summers was a Populist I&rsquo;d go to him just
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam was surprised to hear himself laughing.</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he declared, and he and Hi
tramped on toward town.&nbsp; At the dentist&rsquo;s office Sam
started to turn in with Hi, but Hi stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to come,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I reckon I can stand a little tooth-tinkering.&nbsp; You
get on to Mr. Summers.&nbsp; And&mdash;and, Sam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to stay up there to the house
alone, you come down to our place.&nbsp; My ma, she&rsquo;d love
to have you.&nbsp; Sam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know what trouble is, ma and me, see?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t nobody around these parts know better than we
do.&nbsp; Mr. Carson, he set us on our feet, and now we can hold
up our heads and look people in the face.&nbsp; My, but it feels
good!&nbsp; But we know what trouble is&mdash;all kinds, pretty
near.&nbsp; You come to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam held out a tense hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it there, Hi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi &ldquo;put it there&rdquo; and turned valorously up the
dentist&rsquo;s terrible stairs.</p>
<p>As for Sam, he kept vigorously on his way.&nbsp; He thought of
those automobiles he had seen the day before, and he felt as if
he were all cranked up, with a good spark on, and was ready for a
<a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>long
hard run.&nbsp; So he turned up Burchard Avenue, and in at the
gate of the little Methodist parsonage.</p>
<p>The first person he saw was Mrs. Summers, who had just got
baby Jonathan asleep and was setting him out of doors in his
carriage, to grow.&nbsp; She held up a small brown finger to warn
Sam that conversation was not to be permitted in the vicinity of
the sleeping prince, and led the way into the living room.&nbsp;
Then she went in search of her husband, who, it appeared, was
shut up in the cell-like room he called his study.&nbsp; He came
striding out of his retreat and grasped Sam by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were off to Rutherford, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was, sir, but&mdash;I came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see.&nbsp; Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I heard what they were saying about my father,
sir.&nbsp; Dick Heller told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, he did, eh?&nbsp; It was better on the
whole, I reckon.&nbsp; I had two minds to tell you myself, and
then I just lacked the ginger.&nbsp; But now you know what
you&rsquo;re up against, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; And your folks
left last night, too.&nbsp; Some of the neighbors wanted to have
a posse set out after them and bring them back, but Mr. <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Carson said
Annie Laurie Pace was dead set against it.&nbsp; So he forbade
it.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mind my speaking right out?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s best that way, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best that way,&rdquo; murmured Sam with dry lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve come back, son, to face the
music.&nbsp; Well, what can I do to help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Summers, do you think my father guilty?&nbsp; Do
you think he took the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no more information on the subject than
you,&rdquo; said Mr. Summers.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
think&mdash;as man to man?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p192.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve come back, son, to face the

"&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve come back, son, to face the

 src="images/p192.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>They faced each other silently.&nbsp; Each knew that the other
gave verdict and that it was &ldquo;guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Summers, &ldquo;circumstantial
evidence is a shaky thing.&nbsp; A very shaky, tricky
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam.&nbsp; But there was no hope in
his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask you, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a
hundred dollars that father gave me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to give
that to Annie Laurie if it would help her out any.&nbsp; But what
is a hundred dollars?&nbsp; Why, Mr. <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Pace had thousands and
thousands!&nbsp; And I hear they&rsquo;re having a terrible hard
time altogether&mdash;that they can&rsquo;t get fit helpers, and
that Miss Adnah isn&rsquo;t turning out so good a boss after all,
and that the accounts are getting all mixed up.&nbsp; It looks as
if the whole thing was going to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Summers rather
sharply.</p>
<p>Sam looked up questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they had one good strong, capable helper on the
place, say a man who was willing to work for nothing for the time
being, a man with sense enough to find out the best ways of
feeding cattle and caring for them, and peddling milk, and who
wouldn&rsquo;t mind sitting up after a hard day&rsquo;s work to
straighten out books, and who&rsquo;d try to build up instead of
putting in his best licks tearing down&mdash;the way those fool
hands they have now seem to be doing&mdash;why, there&rsquo;d be
some hope.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean, Mr. Summers, that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Summers took his pipe from the mantel shelf, deliberately
knocked the tobacco out of <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>it, refilled it from a generous
tobacco can and lit a match.&nbsp; While the match burned he
turned toward Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can just stake your life I mean it, son,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will Annie Laurie&mdash;will the aunts let
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reverend Mr. Summers nodded his long, thin head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em to,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Carson will advise &rsquo;em too.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
be making reparation, Samuel.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be squaring
yourself and your family.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get back what
belongs to you, the respect of the community, the regard of
your&mdash;particular friends.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll live here,
in my house, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Summers, I couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you&rsquo;ll live here,&rdquo; roared the tall
preacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d let you go back to
that forsaken house and sit there with all the sneaking ghosts of
memory putting their miserable noses in the doors and windows
o&rsquo; nights, making goblin faces at you?&nbsp; Not
much.&nbsp; Barbara!&nbsp; Barbara, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Barbara came running on her little feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absalom,&rdquo; she whispered excitedly,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>the use in waking the baby?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you know any better than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant collapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willow waly,&rdquo; he gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
I ever remember about that young-un?&nbsp; But, Barbara, I
suppose you have been listening to our conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been sitting in the next room,&rdquo; replied
little Mrs. Summers with dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would have been
impossible for me to avoid hearing parts of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what do you think?&nbsp; Is this boy going
back to that shut-up house of his, or is he going to stay here at
the parsonage?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Barbara smiled her sidelong smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of asking such a silly question as
that?&rdquo; she inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s
going to stay here.&nbsp; I was just thinking I&rsquo;d run up
that rosebud muslin into curtains for his room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Reverend Summers turned a radiant smile on Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the woman for you!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You think you can get ahead of her, but you
can&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d have to be smarter than a possum
to get ahead of her.&nbsp; Rosebud curtains!&nbsp; Now, what <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>do you
think of that, Sam?&nbsp; Could you have got as far as rosebud
curtains in that length of time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught his little wife up in his great arms and tossed her
toward the ceiling as if she had been a baby.&nbsp; Then he
kissed her so loud that the smack must have been heard in the
street, and dropped her in his sleepy hollow chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my hat?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My nice, six-year-old Panama&mdash;the Panama of many
journeys, of my courtship, of my marriage, and probably of my old
age?&nbsp; Why, Sam, you ought to count the rings on that
hat.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n a hundred, I reckon&mdash;if
you judge it like you do oaks.&nbsp; Come, sneak out the back way
so as not to shake the royal bed of the slumbering
potentate.&nbsp; Where are we going?&nbsp; To talk with Miss
Adnah Pace.&nbsp; Yes, I know she&rsquo;s rather a difficult one
to manage.&nbsp; But I can manage her.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
specialty, managing women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped at the window to throw a kiss to his smiling
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, son,&rdquo; he commanded; &ldquo;forward,
march!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>Had
he heard the words ringing in Sam&rsquo;s brain?</p>
<p>Perhaps so.&nbsp; Anyway he spoke them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forward,
march!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He, too, knew Sam was going into
battle.</p>

198</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE DOLL LADY&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Annie Laurie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carson one
Friday afternoon not long after this, &ldquo;will you do Carin
and myself the favor of spending the week end with us?&nbsp; I
will send for you to-morrow morning, if you will do so, and
we&rsquo;ll have a chance to talk.&nbsp; Whenever we try to talk
nowadays, Miss Helena Parkhurst cries out
&lsquo;Physiography!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Grammar!&rsquo; or
&lsquo;American History!&rsquo;&nbsp; Anyone would think she
didn&rsquo;t want us to become acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her finger smilingly at Miss Parkhurst, who was
putting the schoolroom in order at the close of five hard days of
teaching, and was well pleased at the thought that she could
retire to the peace of her own little sitting room and follow her
own inclination for a day or two.&nbsp; There were stitches to
take and letters to write and thoughts to think, and the young
woman who gave so unstintingly of her time and knowledge to three
restless girls, sighed with relief at <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>the thought of being her own
mistress for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mrs. Carson,&rdquo; Annie Laurie had
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should love to come.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t think what a pleasure it would be.&nbsp; But ought I
to leave the aunts?&nbsp; They just sit and watch for me to come
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aunts shall be bidden to Sunday dinner,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be gay
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not say it, but she knew that the flutter of getting
ready for such an event as going out to The Shoals to dinner
would keep Miss Adnah and Miss Zillah well occupied over
Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please come, Annie Laurie,&rdquo; begged Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting quite dull, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie turned to laugh at her friend.&nbsp; Quite
dull!&nbsp; It seemed impossible that anyone could be dull in the
Carson house.&nbsp; Something was nearly always going on.&nbsp;
Mrs. Carson would be giving a luncheon to the ladies interested
in the Mountain Industries, or Mr. Carson would have gentlemen to
dinner&mdash;gentlemen who came down from New York or
Chicago&mdash;or there would be a moonlight picnic, or a riding
party, or a musicale, or Mr. and Mrs. Carson would be packing up
for one of their sudden journeys.&nbsp; <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>It was the
first time that Annie Laurie had been asked to stay overnight at
the mansion.&nbsp; She had been Carin&rsquo;s schoolmate, but
hardly more than that, as she understood very well.&nbsp; She had
a clear mind, capable of seeing things as they were, and it
seemed to her to be a sort of victory that she should, at last,
be asked to join them in so intimate and social a manner.&nbsp;
It showed her that perhaps she was not so &ldquo;stiff&rdquo;
after all.</p>
<p>Her thoughts flew to her clothes, as the thoughts of any girl
will when bidden for a visit.&nbsp; The wardrobe that used to be
so well kept up, in its narrow limits, had grown shabby
now.&nbsp; She had been wearing black for her father, and her
mourning had consisted of frocks which originally had been
colored and which had been dyed.&nbsp; They had not taken the dye
very well, and they felt either rough or flimsy to the
touch.&nbsp; Annie Laurie would have liked to put charming
clothes on that big strong body of hers.&nbsp; Her ideal of
beautiful dressing was before her daily, in Mrs. Carson, whose
dresses, lovely in color and texture, never seemed to have too
much trimming on them, or to do anything but drape and decorate
her slender graceful figure.&nbsp; But Annie Laurie had more
sense than vanity, and <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>she said to herself that she would
not miss such a pleasure and privilege as a two-day visit at The
Shoals because of shabby garments.</p>
<p>She sat, however, late that night, pressing her best black
frock, and sewing fresh ruchings into it, curling her plume with
her sharp little penknife, polishing her boots, putting new bows
on her slippers, and running fresh ribbons in her
underclothes.&nbsp; She packed her satchel daintily, wrapping up
her garments in fresh tissue paper and dropping in a little bag
of lavender.&nbsp; Carin should see that she had the tastes of a
lady, at least.</p>
<p>There was much to do the next morning, too, for the Pace house
was a systematic one, and the Saturday routine must in no way be
neglected.&nbsp; But by half-after-ten, Annie Laurie, fresh, and
glowing with anticipation, stood with her hat and jacket on
waiting for Carin; and not more than a minute behind time, Carin
drove up to the door, all in charming spring green, and carrying
a bunch of pink tulips in her hands for the aunts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re to take a little drive the first thing,
Annie Laurie,&rdquo; announced Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;The valley is
delightful.&nbsp; Everything is bursting into bloom <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>at
once.&nbsp; Mother said we must go and look and look and smell
and smell till we have soaked in the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What care-free, happy people the Carsons were, Annie Laurie
thought.&nbsp; One had only to be with them a very short time to
be convinced that the world was an immensely pleasant place.</p>
<p>So on they went up the sweet valley, over which the mountains
hung with a friendly and benevolent air.&nbsp; The Judas trees
were in bloom and the orchards budding; on every branch the fresh
leaves were starting out, and the crimson maple had flung forth
its beautiful foliage.&nbsp; Annie Laurie felt her heart leaping
in her, and the black care that had been hanging over her of late
lifted like mist before the sun.&nbsp; Looking up, she could see
where Azalea&rsquo;s house was perched fairly upon the edge of
the mountain ledge.&nbsp; There it hung, like an eagle&rsquo;s
great nest, daringly near the long slope of old Mount
Tennyson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a dear&mdash;that Azalea girl?&rdquo;
asked Carin enthusiastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never was there such a
friend!&nbsp; Why, just having her believe in me the way she
does, makes me long to do things.&nbsp; For example, I had known
since I was a very, <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>very small girl that I could draw
and paint a little, and I was forever asking for a studio.&nbsp;
But when mama had given me one, I was so lazy and dreamy that I
hardly did anything in it.&nbsp; Then Azalea got after me.&nbsp;
She said I was going to be a great painter.&nbsp; She found trees
and hills for me to paint.&nbsp; She sat for me herself,
patiently, hour after hour, while I made horrible daubs of
her.&nbsp; But she kept saying I could do better if I tried, and
do you know, by and by I actually did do better.&nbsp; Then papa
decided I had a bit of talent, and he arranged with Mr. Bascomb
to come up from Rutherford once a week to give me
instruction.&nbsp; And by and by when I&rsquo;m old enough
I&rsquo;m to go back to Chicago to the Art Institute, maybe; or
to New York; and afterward if I show I&rsquo;m worth it, to Paris
or Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; sighed Annie Laurie in a sort of
rapture.&nbsp; &ldquo;Paris!&nbsp; Rome!&nbsp; Will you really be
able to go to places like that, Carin?&nbsp; But I
forget&mdash;you already have been to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll go too, sometime, if you want to badly
enough.&nbsp; Of course, it happened to be easy for me.&nbsp;
Papa and mama took me, and I didn&rsquo;t half appreciate it, <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>I was so
young and the chance came so easily.&nbsp; But I shall appreciate
it next time; and maybe you&rsquo;ll go with me.&nbsp; Who
knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie drew back in her seat with a sort of shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Carin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
things aren&rsquo;t going to be like that with me.&nbsp; Fine
chances aren&rsquo;t going to come my way.&nbsp; Once I might
have thought they would, but now everything is changed.&nbsp;
There seems to be so little chance of finding poor dad&rsquo;s
money, and I know so little about earning any.&nbsp; Of course
since Sam came, it&rsquo;s better.&nbsp; The cows are being
properly cared for, the milk gets off in time, and the bills are
sent out correctly, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it fine of him to come back and work for
you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine?&nbsp; I think it was magnificent.&nbsp; At first,
the aunts couldn&rsquo;t understand it at all.&nbsp; You know I
hadn&rsquo;t told them my suspicions about Mr. Disbrow, and I had
begged the neighbors not to do so.&nbsp; The idea hadn&rsquo;t
occurred to them.&nbsp; It was better for them to go on hunting
and prying around all their lives than to get to hating some one
and feeling revengeful.&nbsp; So they couldn&rsquo;t see what Sam
meant by saying he would <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>come and work for us for
nothing.&nbsp; Aunt Adnah never had liked him very well.&nbsp;
She called him &lsquo;that Disbrow boy.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Mr.
Summers and Mr. Carson persuaded her that Sam was going into the
dairy business sometime and that he would consider it a privilege
to work for us and learn the business, and that contented
her.&nbsp; It made her think he was practical and she began to
like him better.&nbsp; As for Sam, he works from early morning
till late at night, and the place begins to look the way it did
when dad was managing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does he seem happy&mdash;Sam?&rdquo; asked
Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;o, I can&rsquo;t say he does quite.&nbsp; But
he&rsquo;s something better than happy.&nbsp; He goes around with
a strange look on his face, as if his own thoughts interested him
more than anything else.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll hardly talk with me at
all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d think that he disliked me, only I know
better.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s ashamed for his family and he
won&rsquo;t intrude on me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s
thinking.&nbsp; At first I tried to make him feel differently,
but then I saw I was bothering him, and so I made up my mind to
let him alone.&nbsp; I reckon he knows I&rsquo;ll never go back
on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;And he hasn&rsquo;t an idea where his people
are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were going West why didn&rsquo;t they take the
train here at Lee?&nbsp; What made them go wandering away in the
mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve talked with Mr. McBirney about that,
and he says Mr. Disbrow was a mountain man born and bred,
although he&rsquo;s been living in town the last few years, and
he says no mountain man would go off and leave his chickens and
cow and dogs behind him.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t so much as occur
to him to do it.&nbsp; Then, too, he thinks Mr. Disbrow
didn&rsquo;t dare try to take the train at Lee.&nbsp; If the
people had seen him going they would have stopped him.&nbsp;
Besides that, I don&rsquo;t believe Mrs. Disbrow would be willing
to go on the train where everybody could see and stare at
her.&nbsp; You know she can&rsquo;t bear to be looked at.&nbsp; I
suppose it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s so like a ghost.&nbsp;
Why, her clothes just hang about her like the rags on a
scarecrow, and her face is the color of dough and all fallen
in.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fact; everyone would turn to look at
her.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t look as if she had lived in the
world at all&mdash;and she hasn&rsquo;t for a good many
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how do you account for Sam?&nbsp; How <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>could a boy
like that come from such a family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Summers says that there&rsquo;s no inheritance for
souls&mdash;that every soul comes fresh from the hand of
God.&nbsp; Sam&rsquo;s soul is too brave to be overcome by his
surroundings.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I can make out of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin shook her head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe that&rsquo;s so.&nbsp; Yet it seems to me
there&rsquo;s more of a mystery to it than that.&nbsp; Your Aunt
Adnah may think he&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Disbrow boy,&rsquo; but he
certainly doesn&rsquo;t seem like it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were turning in at the gate of The Shoals now, and Annie
Laurie looked about her with delight.&nbsp; Gardeners were busy
all over the place; fresh awnings of orange and black had been
hung from the many windows; yellow tulips appeared in flaming
companies along the walks and about the house.&nbsp; Chairs and
tables of brown rattan were on the porches; swinging couches
heaped with pillows invited one to take one&rsquo;s ease; books
and magazines were placed temptingly at hand.&nbsp; Annie Laurie
thought what a contrast all this was to her own meager home, and
gave a sharp little sigh.&nbsp; But she was determined to enjoy
herself without stint for these two bright days.</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>And
this, indeed, was easy to do.&nbsp; Luncheon was served to the
girls in Carin&rsquo;s studio, and there for the greater part of
the afternoon the two read, sang and laughed together.&nbsp;
Carin had at least three books which Annie Laurie &ldquo;simply
must read&rdquo;; and Annie Laurie was insistent that Carin
should do some painting, &ldquo;beginning at the very
beginning,&rdquo; and show her how it was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll paint you,&rdquo; declared Carin, and
made her friend stand, straight and tall before a draping of
red-brown velvet which was just a shade browner than Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ought to be a fine artist to do you
justice,&rdquo; Carin protested, &ldquo;not just a silly niggling
beginner.&nbsp; Just you wait, Annie Laurie!&nbsp; Some day you
are going to be a beautiful woman, and by that time I hope to
know enough to paint you the way you ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a walk in the late afternoon, and tea with Mrs.
Kitchell at the Industries, and then the stroll back in the
lilac-tinted air, and the fun of dressing together for
dinner.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie could hardly make her own toilet for watching
Carin, as she came all fresh from her bath, in her dainty
garments, and <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>slipped into her simple, exquisite frock of clinging
white silk.&nbsp; A maid came to tie her corn-colored scarf, and
to wind the broad corn-colored ribbon about her wonderful hair,
which was almost the same color, only full of light and shine as
no ribbon ever could be.&nbsp; Her slender feet were in white,
too, and about her neck was a necklace of clouded amber
beads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a love you are,&rdquo; cried Annie Laurie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more a love than you are yourself,&rdquo; retorted
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swung her friend around to face the cheval glass, and
Annie Laurie saw her own tall, almost haughty, young figure
mirrored there, in its plain, well fitting gown of black.&nbsp;
She caught a glimpse of her own pretty slippers with their smart
bows, of her straight fair neck&mdash;Carin had forbidden her to
wear her net yoke&mdash;and of her red-brown hair wound around
and around her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about loves!&rdquo; said Carin, and led her friend
down to the drawing room.&nbsp; There were a number of persons
there, it seemed, and Annie Laurie had a confused moment as she
was presented to them.&nbsp; She had not been in this room
before&mdash;at most had glimpsed it from the <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>corridor.&nbsp; Now that she was in it, with the many
candles burning in their sconces, the flowers everywhere in vases
little and great, with the delicate pinks and yellows of the
draperies and furniture making an effect like a wonderful
manufactured flower garden all about her, she had a sick feeling
of shyness and almost wished that she had not accepted Mrs.
Carson&rsquo;s invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s being cowardly,&rdquo; she told
herself sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not afraid of these
people, really.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all kind and good.&nbsp; What
I&rsquo;m afraid of is merely furniture!&nbsp; Now, who would be
afraid of wood and cloth and brass!&nbsp; Silly goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some one&mdash;a pleasant-faced gentleman with white
hair&mdash;offered his arm to the &ldquo;silly goose,&rdquo; and
the next moment they were all making their way to the dining
room.&nbsp; It was wonderful there, too.&nbsp; The lights seemed
to be picked up by the silver and the crystal and to be thrown
back in little sparks at Annie Laurie&rsquo;s dazzled eyes.&nbsp;
There was a bright, hurried talking all about her; a talking she
could not quite follow.&nbsp; But she had got that new idea in
her head, that she was not to be afraid of things like silver and
<a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>glass
and linen, and that certainly no reasonable person could fear
kind friends, and so, in a minute or two, her shyness passed, and
she was herself again.</p>
<p>There were delicious things passed her to eat, and Annie
Laurie wondered what they really could be and why they tasted
different from anything she ever had eaten before.&nbsp; The
gentleman who had taken her out to dinner was very kind, and
talked to her about her lessons, and the early coming of the
spring, and how he had not been in those parts previously, and
how much he liked it, and how he wished he did not have to go
back to Town.&nbsp; By Town, Annie Laurie discovered that he
meant New York.</p>
<p>Then, presently, the conversation died down, and everyone
seemed to be listening to the lady who sat at Mr. Carson&rsquo;s
right.&nbsp; Her name, it seemed, was Miss Borrow, and she was
known, as Mrs. Carson explained, over the mountains as &ldquo;the
doll lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had made a great study of the
mountain country, its flowers and trees, its little wild,
harmless creatures, furred and feathered, and its lonely, quiet
people.&nbsp; Sometimes she traveled for months in a wagon,
sleeping in a mountain cabin or in her wagon as the <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>case might
be, eating at the simple, hospitable tables of the mountaineers,
or cooking by the roadside.&nbsp; And because she was simple and
earnest and truly, truly, a friend to all the world, she had been
permitted to enter the hearts of the people and they had learned
to trust her and to speak out to her almost as freely as they
would to one of themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please tell us why you are called the &lsquo;doll
lady,&rsquo; Miss Borrow,&rdquo; said Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
I know, but I would so love it if you would explain to Annie
Laurie, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Borrow, turning her dark, rather
sad eyes upon Annie Laurie, &ldquo;it was this way.&nbsp; I had
not traveled far in the lonely, silent country that lies back
among the mountains, before I discovered that the saddest thing
about it all was the children&mdash;the little children who had
nothing to look forward to, and who did not know how to laugh in
the happy, free way that children should.&nbsp; They got into bad
and silly ways because there was nothing for them to do.&nbsp; So
I fell to wondering how I could help them enjoy themselves, and
to tell the truth, I hadn&rsquo;t to wonder very long, for almost
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>immediately it occurred to me that I would give them
toys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided that I would take the boys good knives, so
that they could make things, and marbles and balls, so that they
might have games; and to the girls I would take dolls.&nbsp; I
have gone out from my starting point with hundreds of the
dearest, most delightful dollies you could think of, tucked away
in my wagon.&nbsp; I have even had to have a second wagon to
start with, because of the many things I was carrying
along.&nbsp; At first there would be no need to give these things
at the houses at which I stayed&mdash;the houses nearer the
towns.&nbsp; But as I went on and on, over this mountain, and
down into that valley and up over the next mountain, I would come
on the people who lived in the hollow land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had few friends, or none.&nbsp; They went
nowhere.&nbsp; They had nothing to do, except scratch the ground
for a little food.&nbsp; One day was like another; and in the
faces of the children was a look like that to be seen in the face
of a dog&mdash;a look of terrible wistfulness, as if there was
that in the soul which never could be expressed.&nbsp; To these
children I brought my gifts.&nbsp; <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>The boys were glad of the knives and
marbles and balls; but nothing like so glad as the girls were of
the dolls.&nbsp; Many and many of them never had seen a doll at
all.&nbsp; Yet never once did I have to tell them what they were
for.&nbsp; They simply reached out their arms and took them, and
hugged them up to them&mdash;not before people, understand, but
as soon as ever they were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of these lonely little girls had hardly known what
it was to be kissed, and they would have been ashamed to throw
their arms around their mother&rsquo;s necks and hug and kiss
them; but when they got alone with dolly&mdash;their own, own
dolly&mdash;they kissed and hugged it as if they had been starved
for want of things like that.&nbsp; Then when I could take along
some extra things, so that they could really change the
doll&rsquo;s clothes, and wash and iron for their pets, then, at
last, they really had something to do.&nbsp; They seemed to come
to life&mdash;not the dolls, but the little mothers.&nbsp;
Perhaps the dolls did, too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure.&nbsp; They
were loved enough to make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Borrow,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Carson, &ldquo;you
<a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>lucky,
lucky woman, to be able to think of such a lovely thing and to
carry it out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky is that lucky does,&rdquo; said the old gentleman
beside Annie Laurie, twisting an old saying to suit his
purposes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Carin across the table, under cover
of the conversation, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s called
the &lsquo;doll lady,&rsquo; Annie Laurie.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it
beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And&mdash;and why couldn&rsquo;t we help get some of the
dolls ready, Carin?&nbsp; And my aunts&mdash;if I could get them
to working on those dolls, perhaps they wouldn&rsquo;t be
worrying and wondering so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carson overheard her remark, though it was intended only
for Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent and sensible, Annie Laurie,&rdquo; he said in
his light way&mdash;that way which meant so much yet seemed to
mean so little.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have said a wise thing.&nbsp; I
believe the Misses Pace are to honor us with their presence at
dinner to-morrow, are they not, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Carson, &ldquo;I am glad to
be able to say that they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try then, as you say, my dear Annie Laurie, to
help the aunts find a new and <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>interesting occupation.&nbsp; We
will give them&mdash;some dolls to play with,&rdquo; smiled Mr.
Carson.</p>
<p>For he knew, and Annie Laurie knew, that the poor fretted old
ladies needed them as much as any heart-starved mountain
child.</p>
<h2><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LONG RED ROAD</span></h2>
<p>There was music after dinner, and Mrs. Carson asked Annie
Laurie to sing.&nbsp; It was a great moment in its way&mdash;that
in which the shy girl with the oriole&rsquo;s voice went out
before all the company to sing to Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s
accompaniment.&nbsp; For a second or two she thought that she
really could not.&nbsp; Then it came over her that it was a
chance&mdash;that she who had lived that plain drab life was
standing now where beautiful colors played about her.&nbsp; She
was, she said to herself, in the heart of a rainbow.&nbsp; And a
song was a song, just as a piece of furniture was a piece of
furniture.&nbsp; She had already decided that she was not to be
afraid of upholstering and silver and fine glass.&nbsp; Very
well, then, why should she be afraid of a song, since she really
had a voice and could sing?&nbsp; Her music lessons had been
stopped since her father&rsquo;s death, but Mrs. Carson often
invited her to sing with her in the schoolroom where
Carin&rsquo;s piano stood, and she <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>was quite aware that she had learned
more from Mrs. Carson with her taste and her beautiful, delicate
fashion of expression than she could from her teacher.&nbsp; So
now, full, free, sad and deep, her young voice arose in:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All are sleeping, weary heart,<br />
Thou, thou only sleepless art.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She thought of Sam away in his bare room, bending over those
puzzling accounts of hers, working for her without pay, to redeem
so far as he could his father&rsquo;s terrible wrong.&nbsp; And
as she thought of him, and the beauty of the song opened the
doors of her heart, it seemed as if all that distrust of mankind
which had come to her so bitterly when she first realized the
great wrong that had been done her, went drifting out on the tide
of song.&nbsp; So the lovely words to their noble setting poured
from her lips with a sort of splendor, and when she had ceased,
and had stood for a moment, motionless, her slender straight body
tense with the rapture of it, she had the great happiness of
hearing sincere and enthusiastic applause break from all the
company in the drawing room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carson and Carin were hardly less happy <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>than
she.&nbsp; They made her sing again and again; then Mrs. Carson
forbade more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not have our singing bird excited so that
she&rsquo;ll lose her sleep the first night she stays under this
roof,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; And then she herself, at the
solicitation of her guests, sang some of those wonderful songs of
hers.&nbsp; Annie Laurie could not understand the words, for they
were now in one tongue and now another; but as the music rose and
fell, shifting in its beauty as a sunset shifts its colors, or as
water ripples in the wind, a great happiness flooded her.&nbsp;
She sat thrilling to it, moved to the core of her being by its
rhythm, and Mrs. Carson, arising from the piano, came straight to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie Laurie Pace,&rdquo; she said in her charming way,
&ldquo;I could feel all the strings of the piano vibrating again
in you.&nbsp; You are a true musician.&nbsp; Sometime you and I
will sit together night after night and listen to
opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Annie Laurie gasped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Carson.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wait, child.&nbsp; Wait just a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, with a head full of new, rich ideas, the girl lay down to
sleep that night in <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>the &ldquo;poppy room,&rdquo; as the
little bedroom opening off Carin&rsquo;s was called.&nbsp;
Poppies decorated the wall, were embroidered on the linen covers
to dresser, chairs and bed, and the spirit of poppies, sleep,
hovered lightly over the room.</p>
<p>The next day dawned beautifully&mdash;one of those Sundays
which seem to have the very breath of holiness in them.&nbsp;
Annie Laurie went with the Carsons to the Episcopal Church, and
then they all drove over to the Methodist Church for the
aunts.&nbsp; They could see the two, prim and starched, awaiting
them on the high church steps, and Mr. Carson leaped from the
carriage to assist the ladies down and to help them into his
vehicle.&nbsp; Annie Laurie couldn&rsquo;t help giving an
affectionate chuckle at the labored propriety of their
remarks.&nbsp; They had on their best dresses and they were
determined to use their best language.&nbsp; But Mrs. Carson gave
no sign that she perceived their stiffness.&nbsp; She chatted on
in that winning way of hers, till even the proud and difficult
Aunt Adnah felt at ease.</p>
<p>At dinner the conversation turned upon the &ldquo;doll
lady,&rdquo; and Mr. Carson had an idea.</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,
we&rsquo;ll hike it!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll trek it!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
mush-mush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; Carin protested, &ldquo;what ever
<i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean?&nbsp; I mean we&rsquo;ll follow the long red
road, every one of us.&nbsp; Your mother, Carin, and your friends
Annie Laurie and Azalea, and Miss Zillah and Miss Adnah.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll take to the high road&mdash;in mountain
wagons&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll go gypsying.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
spring vacation&mdash;or we can make it so if we have a
mind.&nbsp; What do you say, Miss Parkhurst?&nbsp; Shall we call
it vacation?&nbsp; And will you go with us over the
mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call it vacation if you please, sir,&rdquo;
smiled Helena Parkhurst.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if I have any time away
from my duties, I&rsquo;d love to go home to my mother.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s very lonely without me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall, then.&nbsp; Of course she&rsquo;s lonely
without you.&nbsp; But what do you say, ladies?&rdquo; he asked,
turning to Annie Laurie&rsquo;s aunts.</p>
<p>Miss Adnah wiped her lips carefully before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind indeed, sir, but I never have done
such a thing in my life, though I must say that I have rather
envied people when I saw them starting off on such an
expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>&ldquo;Of course you have envied them, and you shall do
so no longer.&nbsp; You shall go and know the joys they have
known.&nbsp; As for the dairy, Sam will look after that.&nbsp; If
necessary he can have one of my men to help him.&nbsp; You are
pleased, I hope, Miss Zillah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Zillah turned her faded, quiet eyes on him, and smiled
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carson,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;all my life I have
slept properly under a roof.&nbsp; I have done my duty as I saw
it to do.&nbsp; I have conducted myself, I hope, in a ladylike
and discreet manner, but&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But from childhood I have longed to cook my meal in a
pot over a camp fire and to sleep under the pines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; went on Miss Zillah, showing
the shadow of a dimple in her withered cheek, &ldquo;I feel that
I would love to run about in a short skirt and tie a turban about
my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delightful!&nbsp; Delightful,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go by the middle of this
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Carson, ought we?&rdquo; Miss Adnah broke
in.&nbsp; &ldquo;The&mdash;the expense&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>&ldquo;Expense, madam?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
expense.&nbsp; All that is needed is time, and of that we have as
much as anybody living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up a hand for silence, and in his rich voice, warm
with an almost boyish enthusiasm, he repeated a poem he had read
but whose author he did not remember:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Beyond the East, the sunrise, beyond
the West, the sea&mdash;<br />
And East or West, the wander-thirst will never let me be.<br />
It works in me like madness, dear, to make me say good-bye,<br />
For the stars call and the sea calls, and O! the call of the
sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know not where the white road leads, nor what
the blue hills are,<br />
But a man can have the sun for a friend, and for his guide a
star.<br />
And there&rsquo;s no end of voyaging when once the voice is
heard,<br />
For the river calls and the road calls, and O! the call of the
bird.</p>
<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yonder the long horizon lies, and there
by night or day,<br />
The old ships draw to home again, the young ships sail away,<br
/>
And come I may, but go I must, and if you ask me why,<br />
You may put the blame on the stars and sun, and the white road
and the sky.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Only it&rsquo;s the red road with us, ladies&mdash;the
long red road, and it winds up the mountains, and down the
mountains, and we&rsquo;ll follow it till we long for home
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; whispered Annie Laurie to Carin as they
walked from the dining room together, &ldquo;how fine it will be
to get the poor aunts away from that house where they worry and
search, and search and worry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; returned Carin,
&ldquo;that papa is really having in the back of his mind the
idea that he may run across the Disbrows?&nbsp; He thinks that,
after all, Mr. Disbrow won&rsquo;t quite dare spend that
money&mdash;at least not much of it.&nbsp; He could talk about
going West but he hasn&rsquo;t really the courage to go.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll drive around in the mountains, shooting a little, and
grazing his cow and horses, and eating up the chickens.&nbsp; <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>Papa says
that&rsquo;s the way a man with his rearing would do,
probably.&nbsp; So we&rsquo;re to take to all sorts of byroads
and odd ways in the hope of finding them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Annie Laurie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But&mdash;Oh, Carin, if we found them!&nbsp; What a
humiliation for them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so far as Mr. Disbrow is concerned, I think he
has some humiliation coming to him,&rdquo; said Carin
sharply.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie hated to tell Sam they were going to the
mountains.&nbsp; She feared he would read in her eyes her
knowledge of this second intention&mdash;this hope of finding the
fugitives.&nbsp; Perhaps he did.&nbsp; He was very silent these
days, and he worked furiously.&nbsp; Annie Laurie tried to get
him to sit with them evenings, but he would not.&nbsp; His
old-time light-heartedness, preserved under so many difficulties,
seemed to have passed entirely.&nbsp; Yet he was not sullen nor
even sad&mdash;only very grave.&nbsp; He was indeed fighting his
battle, and it was not an easy one.</p>
<p>But little by little he could see&mdash;everyone could
see&mdash;that he was winning the respect of the
townspeople.&nbsp; Men went out of their way <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>to speak to
him and to ask him how he was getting on in his new business and
to say they&rsquo;d be glad to help him out if he got in any
difficulty.&nbsp; Some of the nicest women in Lee invited him to
their homes; but to all such invitations Sam sent a respectful
refusal.&nbsp; He seemed determined to keep to himself until he
had won his right to enter other men&rsquo;s doors as an honest
boy, the son of an honest man.</p>
<p>He helped with the preparations for the mountain, saying
nothing of his shamed and tortured thought that his friends might
come upon his skulking family.&nbsp; Mr. Carson was to drive his
own team, and Benjamin, his man, was to drive Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s horses.&nbsp; So, on a perfumed spring morning the
little caravan set off, with Mrs. Carson and the two Misses Pace
in the Carson wagon, and Carin and Azalea in Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Azalea was strangely excited by the idea of the journey,
though she tried to conceal the fact.&nbsp; She could not forget
how often she had gone upon such long journeys in those wild,
curious days when she was a &ldquo;show girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those
days now seemed like a fantastic dream.&nbsp; She felt as if she
always had been Azalea McBirney, wrapped about with love and
consideration; and <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>even the memory of her poor dead little mother was like
a gray shadow.&nbsp; True, it was a shadow which arose often
before her mental vision, but the outlines of it grew fainter and
fainter.&nbsp; Yet Azalea loved it.&nbsp; She could not think of
that brave, yet broken woman, so out of place with that sorry
crew of show people, without a throb of love.&nbsp; Death had, at
last, seemed the only happiness for her, and Azalea loved to
think of her as safe and at rest in that much-cared-for lowly bed
of hers beneath the Pride of India tree beside Ma
McBirney&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>And, oh, the long red road!&nbsp; How it wound up the hills
and over them.&nbsp; What valleys it glimpsed, what rivers, amber
brown beneath the trees, what spots of quietude and peace beneath
the pines, what sunny openings, where succulent odors of grass,
freshly sprung, came to the travelers!&nbsp; And, oh, the delight
of sleeping in the hastily spread tents&mdash;which were really
no more than squares of canvas stretched on pointed
sticks&mdash;and the appetites that developed for the meals
cooked over the coals on the convenient tripod!</p>
<p>Now one and now another of the ladies cooked the meals, and
they vied with each other in the <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>mixing of stews.&nbsp; They grew
bold and tried things they never had heard of, but which seasoned
with mountain air and tested with mountain appetites, seemed the
finest of discoveries.&nbsp; And the day and the night were
sweet; the wind was their playful companion; the showers were
their friends; the sun their great protector; the moon their
comforter and all the stars were their intimates.</p>
<p>So the three girls grew browner and brighter-eyed each day,
and the heart in each of them&mdash;even Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s&mdash;was light as down.</p>
<p>But not a hint did they have of the Disbrows.&nbsp; Though
they plunged deeper and deeper into the mountains, getting far
beyond the towns, they saw nothing of them.&nbsp; They went so
far that they came at last upon the lonely, sad-eyed people whom
Miss Borrow had described.&nbsp; In their miserable cabins, which
were far from weatherproof, they lived their curious, solitary
lives.&nbsp; Their faces were vacant and mournful; their voices
like the soughing of wind in the trees.&nbsp; They walked
languidly, and there was a strange and repellent pallor in their
faces.&nbsp; Sometimes they sang a little, sitting before their
doors <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>in
the moonlight, and their voices rose and fell with a curious
cadence.&nbsp; The monotony of their lives rested upon them like
a deadly spell, permitting them to nurse senseless hates and
animosities, and to keep up foolish family feuds.</p>
<p>Now and then they came upon a desolate schoolhouse, approached
by little winding paths, over which bare-footed children had run
for weary miles.&nbsp; For they prized their schooling beyond all
words to express.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whar is her who tells us how?&rdquo; one little,
sallow-faced child had asked when she had run eleven miles to the
schoolhouse to find the teacher absent.&nbsp; They heard such
stories of starved minds and all but starved bodies, and a deep
pity awoke in their hearts for these people of their own blood
and of an inheritance much like their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we are a little older,&rdquo; said Azalea, her
eyes shining with a deep purpose, &ldquo;we will come back and
teach them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will
teach them to read and to sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To read and to sing and to draw,&rdquo; said Carin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Carson, laughingly and yet
with meaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll send some one <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>along to
help with such trifles as arithmetic, geography, grammar, et
cetera, and incidentally I&rsquo;ll foot the bills.&nbsp; Is it a
bargain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; said they in chorus.</p>
<h2><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HI&rsquo;S HOUN&rsquo; DAWG</span></h2>
<p>It was Saturday and Hi Kitchell and Jim McBirney, having done
their chores, met by appointment at the spring under the tulip
trees where Azalea intended to build her bungalow when she became
very rich.</p>
<p>It was a lovely spot and they threw themselves down in perfect
content, their dogs near at hand, and looked off at what Hi
called a &ldquo;purty worl&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It jes&rsquo; seems like everything worth
speakin&rsquo; about hed come my way,&rdquo; sighed Hi
contently.&nbsp; &ldquo;You-all remember what a pore little
forsaken cuss I was, Jim, when me and &rsquo;Zalie came
draggin&rsquo; along with that thar show of Sisson&rsquo;s a year
back an&rsquo; more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint more&rsquo;n a year, Hi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like a century.&nbsp; An&rsquo; no sooner hed we
laid eyes on your pa and ma than things began to go right.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; now look at us.&nbsp; &rsquo;Zalie&rsquo;s like your
sister and gettin&rsquo; a tip-top education, and is off
ridin&rsquo; the country over with the Carsons; <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>and me and
ma hev a home anybody would be proud to own, and that thar
Industries business is lookin&rsquo; up more&rsquo;n more every
livelong day.&nbsp; Why we&rsquo;re so happy we&rsquo;re in
danger of bustin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I asked ma t&rsquo;other day if
she didn&rsquo;t feel most like bustin&rsquo;, and she said she
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good place to live here-abouts,&rdquo;
agreed Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pleasant things have a way of
happenin&rsquo; &rsquo;round here.&nbsp; If it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
for that dod-gasted hard luck of Annie Laurie&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;d
think this was where the nicest folks in creation lived.&nbsp;
But some one done her a mean, low-down trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that scowlin&rsquo;, grumblin&rsquo;
Disbrow,&rdquo; averred Hi.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know it.&nbsp; Ma says
she feels it in her bones, and so do I, and Kitchell bones is
simply great for givin&rsquo; pointers.&nbsp; I say, what&rsquo;s
the use in you and me loafin&rsquo; &rsquo;round here while that
mis&rsquo;able, sneakin&rsquo; houn&rsquo; gets off with Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s money?&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t we her friends and as
nigh kin as she&rsquo;s got?&nbsp; What say to you and me
hikin&rsquo; out after that thar Disbrow an&rsquo; findin&rsquo;
him and bringin&rsquo; him back to justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi&rsquo;s sharp black eyes sparkled with the high intent of
protecting the friendless.&nbsp; The bright light of adventure
shone round about him, and Jim thrilled to it.&nbsp; Here was a
friend worth <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>having&mdash;a friend like those knights of old of whom
Azalea read to him, one who would go out and conquer.&nbsp; Jim
stared off across the purple valley, rejoicing in his good
fortune at living in days when there was still a man&rsquo;s work
to do in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he breathed after a time, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Hi, with something of the air of an
Arctic explorer about to embark on his hazardous voyage,
&ldquo;we must make ready.&nbsp; Thar&rsquo;s no use in
waitin&rsquo; around here, dreamin&rsquo; and sighin&rsquo; the
way the rest of the town is doin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get
our grub together and be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could take Peter,&rdquo; said Jim
wistfully.&nbsp; Peter was his hound.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s
got such a sore foot I don&rsquo;t dast.&nbsp; Ma, she doctors it
up every morning and she says we&rsquo;ll have to be mighty
careful or we won&rsquo;t have no dog at all&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
die from blood poisonin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; agreed Hi, &ldquo;but we-all
ken take Bike.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bike, Hi&rsquo;s hound, wagged his
tail in recognition of the attention paid him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will make me feel awful bad for you to take Bike and
me to be goin&rsquo; along without no dog at all,&rdquo; mused
Jim.</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>There
seemed to be no limit to Hi&rsquo;s chivalry to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, by gum, I won&rsquo;t take Bike,&rdquo; he
declared, his face lighting with the glow of sacrifice.&nbsp; Jim
was not unappreciative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest, Hi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s send the dogs home and we can go
right on from here.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t need no
provisions.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got some money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of delayin&rsquo; then.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s set off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the dogs were commanded to go to their respective homes,
and with lowered tails and drooping ears, they obeyed.&nbsp; Bike
writhed along on his belly, beating the ground with his
tail.&nbsp; He actually shed tears of humiliation and depression,
but Peter, more absorbed with the discomfort in his foot, limped
lamely and obediently on his way toward home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pore houn&rsquo;s,&rdquo; sighed Hi, &ldquo;they sure
are cast down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it just their luck,&rdquo; Jim
sympathized.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pore critters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys were talking their worst and <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>enjoying
it.&nbsp; This spang-up grammar was well enough to catch on to
when a fellow was talking with Mrs. Carson, or even to Azalea,
but there was such a thing as letting down and enjoying oneself
when the ladies were out of the way.&nbsp; Men must be men now
and then.</p>
<p>So, in all the freemasonry of their kind, the two set off
across the mountain.&nbsp; Neither one would have confessed that
the &ldquo;wander-thirst&rdquo; was on them too.&nbsp; But the
truth was, Mr. Carson had set a most infectious example.&nbsp;
Mountain folks have pretty hard work staying at home.&nbsp; The
roads call, and they long to be up and away.&nbsp; It always
seems as if something wonderful must be waiting for them over the
next hill.&nbsp; Jim and Hi had the gypsy mood on them this
day.&nbsp; They actually ran for a long time, taking the cut-offs
that led them over the spur of the mountain to Mulberry Valley,
which lay &ldquo;over-yon&rdquo; and which they had seldom
visited, and then always under the guidance of some grown person
who insisted on pushing them along and getting home again.</p>
<p>Getting home seemed to them just now as the last thing in the
world that a fellow would care to do.&nbsp; What was the use in
getting home when <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>a person could run along paths bordered with trim
huckleberry bushes, or rest on a stone where lichen had woven a
pale green lace?&nbsp; There were partridge berries peeping up
between dark green leaves; here was tender wintergreen; yonder
the &ldquo;sweet buds&rdquo; were coming out, weighting the air
with their fruity odor.&nbsp; Dear me, why should anybody go
home?</p>
<p>There was an eagle hanging over the valley, strong, and calm,
and sure.&nbsp; Three buzzards sat on a blasted pine and shook
their evil heads; a king snake gave them a chase and got away
from them in spite of their best endeavors.&nbsp; And still the
little path went on and on.&nbsp; It passed by a deserted house,
where the bats hung from the roof.&nbsp; It wound by wooded hills
and fields that once had been tilled, but had perhaps proved too
unfertile, and so been left; it crept on up the farther
mountain,&mdash;the unknown mountain&mdash;and still coaxed, and
lured, and solicited; and the boys kept on.</p>
<p>Their brown, dusty feet had grown weary and their throats were
dry when at length they came upon a cabin.&nbsp; They
weren&rsquo;t sure at first whether it was lived in or not.&nbsp;
The heavy shutters&mdash;there were no windows&mdash;were closed,
but the <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>door stood slightly ajar.&nbsp; The chimney, which was
made of field stone held together with the red clay of the field,
blossomed like a garden with ferns and vines.&nbsp; The yard was
bare of grass, but the old stone wall round about it was
overgrown with green things, though it was still so early in the
year, and the myrtle and mimosa showed their green beside that of
the laurel and rhododendron.&nbsp; There was a small well with a
sweep, and on the bench lay a broken gourd which had been used as
a drinking cup.&nbsp; But over the place was the deepest silence,
save for one early bee which made a cheerful buzzing, and seemed
to fairly boom, so still was the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; whispered Hi, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t it look
spooky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe a hermit lives here,&rdquo; Jim suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a skelington,&rdquo; added Hi.</p>
<p>It was Hi who had the courage to push back the warped door and
look in.&nbsp; Jim was a few feet behind him and he never forgot
the yell of horror that came from Hi&rsquo;s throat, a yell that
had fear in it, fear for the next second&rsquo;s happening.&nbsp;
Jim heard a swishing and a hissing, and he knew.&nbsp; Neither
formed the word &ldquo;rattlers!&rdquo; on their frozen
tongues.&nbsp; Hi tried to leap backward and fell over a stub of
a bush and lay <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>prone.&nbsp; Jim seized his arm and dragged him along
for a dozen feet, and even in the rush they could hear their
hearts beating frantically.&nbsp; That swishing and hissing kept
up.&nbsp; It seemed to grow louder.&nbsp; Hi turned himself and
got on his feet like a monkey.&nbsp; They both ran without
looking behind.&nbsp; And after they had started and had got away
from the real danger, they began to fear imaginary evils.&nbsp;
Panic was on them.&nbsp; With their blistered bare feet they sped
on and on, taking no note of where they were going.&nbsp; Their
throats, which had been dry to start with, became like
paper.&nbsp; Their eyes bulged from their heads.&nbsp; They had
started out great heroes, but they had undergone a transformation
and were two terribly frightened and tired little boys.</p>
<p>Even as they sank exhausted beneath a pine tree they looked
about them shudderingly for snakes, but seeing none they lay
there and gasped, their hearts straining in their sides.&nbsp;
Then, as their panting ceased, a soft noise struck their
ears.&nbsp; It sounded very familiar, and yet in their utter
bewilderment they could not at first tell what it was.&nbsp; The
meaning penetrated first to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spring,&rdquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
spring!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>They
made their way toward it, dragging their feet like weary dogs,
and when they saw it, clear, cold and beautiful, gushing from the
ground amid wild forget-me-nots, they sank on their knees and
drank long.&nbsp; After that they lay still, staring at the
sky.&nbsp; The world swam before them dreamily, the clouds rocked
back and forth; they slept.</p>
<p>When they awoke it was dark.&nbsp; It was not just partly dark
as it is most nights of the year.&nbsp; No, it was black.&nbsp;
They might have been shut up in a black velvet box or lost in a
large bottle of black ink.&nbsp; There was nothing above, below,
around, so far as their sense could inform them.&nbsp; It was Jim
who had opened his eyes first.&nbsp; At least, he thought he had
opened them, but when he found he could see nothing at all he had
his doubts about having done it.&nbsp; He felt of his
eyelids.&nbsp; Yes, they were open, beyond doubt.&nbsp; Had he
then suddenly gone blind?&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t imagine why he
should, and yet, judging from his present plight, it seemed
probable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he shouted, as if Hi were on the other side
of a forty-acre lot.</p>
<p>Hi&rsquo;s voice answered close at hand, sleepily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yep!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;Hi, I believe I&rsquo;ve gone blind.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t see nothing&mdash;not a blamed thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a short silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t neither,&rdquo; cried Hi.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re both blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s being so hungry, I reckon,&rdquo; said
Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think a fellah could get so run
down from eatin&rsquo; nothing that he&rsquo;d go
blind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he might,&rdquo; sighed Hi.</p>
<p>Silence fell again.&nbsp; They could hear the needles as they
fell from the trees, the low whispering of the spring, and the
far-away sound of wind or rain, they were not sure which.</p>
<p>Then suddenly they knew that they were not blind.&nbsp; All
the world was lit up&mdash;lit up terribly and then engulfed in
darkness again.&nbsp; Then the thunder came, clamoring and
roaring about them.&nbsp; They were mountain boys and they had
heard thunder roar and rumble over the hills many times, but had
it ever had such a frightful bellow as this?&nbsp; It kept on and
on and before the first volley had quite died, again the world
was lighted with that fiery light&mdash;that forked
flame&mdash;and again the voice of the sky awoke the thousand
voices of the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gosh!&rdquo; groaned Hi.</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there no place to hide?&rdquo;
demanded Jim with trembling voice.</p>
<p>No, there was no place to hide.&nbsp; The storm king owned
everything around there that night.&nbsp; It was all his domain
and he meant to do with it as he would.&nbsp; So he blasted an
oak, and the boys saw it; and he cracked his horrid whip at the
invisible horses of the air, and they rushed by screaming.&nbsp;
And then the rain came; not drop by drop as rain should, but in
drops that chased each other so that they became streams; in
streams that became inverted fountains.</p>
<p>The boys couldn&rsquo;t even call out to each other.&nbsp;
They fought for breath as the furious winds whipped them and the
drenching rain engulfed them almost like a wave.&nbsp; It was a
cloudburst, they knew that much, and finally, from mere animal
instinct, they turned their faces to the ground, wreathed their
arms about their heads and lay prone.&nbsp; Still the lightning
flashed and the thunder bellowed; still the winds wailed and the
trees snapped.&nbsp; It seemed at last merely a question of
keeping alive till it was over.</p>
<p>But by and by it was over.&nbsp; It ceased almost as suddenly
as it had come, and weak as half-drowned rats the two boys got to
their feet, and <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>looking up into a clear sky, saw the morning star
shining down at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get home,&rdquo; said Jim, breathing
deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Hi.</p>
<p>It was some time before they could find any sort of a trail
whatever, but after a while they came upon one, though whether it
had been made by human feet long since and overgrown, or whether
it was merely a rabbit run they could not decide.&nbsp; However,
they decided to take it.&nbsp; The dawn was flushing the sky and
they could make their way without much difficulty now, so far as
seeing was concerned, but their feet were blistered and their
bodies felt as sore as if they had been pounded.&nbsp; They went
on and on, doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound to come to a road soon,&rdquo; they
kept telling each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;ll get somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they got &ldquo;somewhere,&rdquo; beyond any manner of
doubt.&nbsp; Lifting their eyes at length, they saw before them
that frightful cabin of &ldquo;rattlers,&rdquo; and stealing to
the door to greet the brightly shining sun was a fine, confident
father of rattlers.&nbsp; Hi gave one despairing whoop and <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>fled, Jim
following, and once more they sped on, taking however an opposite
direction from that of the night before and trying to keep their
faces toward home.&nbsp; There was the mountain before them to
cross, and then Mulberry Valley, and then there was Tennyson
mountain to climb.&nbsp; It was really quite simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody ought to be able to do that,&rdquo; said Hi
stoutly.</p>
<p>But the trouble was that after an hour&rsquo;s hard plodding
they came to a sort of opening and thought they had reached a
road at last, and there before them once more was the House of
Rattlers.&nbsp; And that was the time they gave up and
cried.&nbsp; They dared not stay near there, so they went on
their way hastily, but not running now, sobbing as they went.</p>
<p>They were lost, that was all there was to it.&nbsp; They were
quite completely lost on a mountain they never had visited
before&mdash;a mountain where nobody lived and where the only
neighborly things were rattle snakes.</p>
<p>They were both wondering if they were going to die there, to
starve and be heard of no more.&nbsp; Of course, years and years
from then their &ldquo;skelingtons&rdquo; might be found.&nbsp;
But <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>however interesting that might be for others, it really
would do them no good at all, when you came to think of it.</p>
<p>Ugh, how chilly the morning air was!&nbsp; And how wet their
clothes were!&nbsp; And how empty their stomachs!&nbsp; And the
rattlers&mdash;the rattlers!</p>
<p>There was a strange, bell-like sound in the distance, a deep,
musical, beautiful sound.&nbsp; It rang over the hills with a
note at once sad and glad.&nbsp; The boys stopped in their tracks
and listened.&nbsp; It came again, like church bells, only
faster.&nbsp; It thrilled the two forlorn wanderers, and brought
the light back to their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bike!&rdquo; shouted Hi.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Bike.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s followed us.&nbsp; Oh, Bike, Bike, here we
are, you blessed old houn&rsquo; dawg!&nbsp; Here!&nbsp;
Here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They put their fingers in their mouths and whistled, they
shouted, they laughed, they hugged each other; and then, over a
rise came Bike, wild-eyed with delight, large, it seemed, as a
bear, and bursting with importance.</p>
<p>He leaped on them till he knocked them down; he insisted on
licking their faces, on pretending to bite their calves, on
lathering them as if they were puppies.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
have enough of <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>them nor they of him.&nbsp; But after all, he came to
his senses sooner than they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of this,&rdquo; he seemed to say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For goodness sake, let&rsquo;s be getting home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his back on them and started over the rise, wagging
his tail and giving vent to sharp, scolding barks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine lot of trouble you&rsquo;ve put me to,&rdquo; he
appeared to be saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hustle yourselves now and get
home.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know your folks are worried to death
about you?&nbsp; Such boys!&nbsp; Such boys!&nbsp; It wears a
respectable hound out trying to take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the boys understood and agreed with him.&nbsp; So they
followed meekly enough, limping first on one foot and then on the
other and calling to him every few minutes not to go so fast.</p>
<p>They went on for hours and hours, as it seemed, but at last
they stood beneath the tulip trees by the spring on
Azalea&rsquo;s plateau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hi, &ldquo;this here is whar we
part.&nbsp; We-all don&rsquo;t seem to be bringin&rsquo; the
Disbrows back to get their just punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d better not say much about
punishment,&rdquo; grinned the leg-weary Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
long, Hi.&nbsp; Hope it don&rsquo;t hurt much.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>&ldquo;Same to you,&rdquo; called Hi.&nbsp; He and Bike
were already on their way down the mountain, and Jim, tired
almost to collapse, made his way up the road to where Ma McBirney
paced back and forth, pouring out her soul in prayer.</p>
<p>But Pa McBirney seemed to have some feelings which did not
come under the head of gratitude for his son&rsquo;s
return.&nbsp; He knew what such a night of torture meant to the
dear woman beside him, who already had suffered too many
shocks.&nbsp; He looked Jim over with a sternly parental eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you got what&rsquo;s coming to you, son,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be well lathered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, sir,&rdquo; said Jim with conviction.</p>
<p>Pa hesitated.&nbsp; He was a gentle man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you know it, and if you
think you&rsquo;ll remember it, latherin&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t
teach you nothing.&nbsp; Go in with your ma and get some food,
and then wash yourself up and go to bed.&nbsp; Ma&rsquo;d better
give you some of that salve o&rsquo; hern for your feet.&nbsp;
And Jim&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You watch out jest as hard as you can, and don&rsquo;t
grow up a plumb fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<h2><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE VOICE IN THE MIST</span></h2>
<p>It has been said that Mr. Carson set an example for the people
at Lee which many were tempted to follow.&nbsp; And partly it was
the spring calling them; partly it was an itching desire to find
the Disbrows.&nbsp; Lee was pretty well disgusted with itself as
time went on, for not starting after the absconding undertaker
and his family immediately after their disappearance, and they
told themselves they certainly would have done it if Mr. Carson
hadn&rsquo;t been so dead set against it.&nbsp; And he was put up
to acting the way he did, they knew, by Annie Laurie, who was too
soft-hearted altogether.</p>
<p>It was a little surprising, all things considered, that the
Reverend Absalom Summers should have been the next after Hi and
Jim to yield to the temptation to take to the hills.&nbsp;
Resisting temptation, as his little wife pointed out to him,
ought to be his specialty.&nbsp; But he contrived to down her
argument.</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to understand my noble soul
at all, Barbara,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;My real reason for
taking to the hills is that I want to visit my two uncles back on
Longstreet Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you visit them, Absalom, dear?&nbsp; Do
you really care about seeing them?&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t they two
quarrelsome old men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are some quarrelsome, Barbara, and
that&rsquo;s why I think I ought to see them, carrying a dove of
peace on my shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d kill a dove of peace and eat it,
wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she asked laughingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they shoot everything in sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty nigh,&rdquo; agreed Absalom.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
certainly do have nervous dispositions.&nbsp; They own a lot of
land up there on Longstreet Mountain, and the two of them used to
live side by side.&nbsp; But their chickens were so inquisitive
about what was doing in the next yard, and they got so mixed up
running through the fence and forgetting which place was home,
that there was a row on early and late between my uncles.&nbsp;
It was the same with the calves.&nbsp; If they wanted to break
into a field and eat up the corn, they always picked out the
field of the next door neighbor.&nbsp; And that made the brothers
just dancing <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>mad.&nbsp; Then once Uncle Ephriam shot a hound of
Uncle Aaron&rsquo;s&mdash;said he thought it was a timber
wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it went.&nbsp; There was always trouble.&nbsp;
When they heard I&rsquo;d become a preacher they sent for me to
come up and straighten things out.&nbsp; I stayed up there a
month and talked things over and I couldn&rsquo;t get either old
stiff-neck to give an inch.&nbsp; So I worked out a plan.&nbsp;
Aaron had a likely building site for his house, but Uncle
Ephriam&rsquo;s was on a slope and water ran into the cellar when
it rained.&nbsp; Well, just in front of them was a deep
ravine&mdash;mighty pretty it is too.&nbsp; I proposed that
Ephriam should move across to the other side of that
gulley.&nbsp; I told him if he would, I&rsquo;d stay and help him
put up his house.&nbsp; So Aaron bought Ephriam&rsquo;s old house
to use for a barn, and Ephriam moved&mdash;chickens, stock, truck
and all&mdash;across the gulley.&nbsp; We got him a nice sizable
house there, and settled him and his wife as comfortable as you
please.&nbsp; It was altogether too much work for the calves and
the chickens to get across that crack in the earth, and so
everyone lived in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was fine.&nbsp; But why should you leave <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Jonathan
and me to go to see them if they&rsquo;re doing so
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t doing so well as you might think,
wife.&nbsp; No sooner had I got those families separated, by a
convulsion of nature, so to speak, than they took to pining for
each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Absalom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact, my dear.&nbsp; They were as lonely
as owls.&nbsp; Said they didn&rsquo;t have anyone to talk to, and
that it wore them all out plunging up and down that
gulley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what can you do about that?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
propose moving Uncle Ephriam back again, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Barbara, not at all.&nbsp; I merely propose
making conversation easy and simple for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; A telephone would be out of place in
the hands of my reverend uncles.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t precisely
tell you why, but you&rsquo;ll have to take my word that it
would.&nbsp; No, what I propose to do is to carry them
megaphones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Megaphones, Absalom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; Megaphones will become them.&nbsp;
They are sturdy, seafaring sort of men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;ve never seen the
sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so literal, dear.&nbsp; They are sturdy,
space-roaming, wilderness-faring men in whose hands megaphones
will be appropriate.&nbsp; I shall strap one on each side of my
horse and set forth&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will you get your sermon prepared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall prepare it while I&rsquo;m riding.&nbsp;
Seriously, Barbara, the wild man in me is uppermost.&nbsp; You
have tried to civilize me.&nbsp; Our young son has labored to do
the same thing.&nbsp; But you scratch a Russian and find a
Tartar; and you scratch a mountain man and you find a
rover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been scratched, wild man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m off to-morrow.&nbsp; Bear with
me, dear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come back as tame as a house
cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbara looked at him with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a wonderful sermon,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know you, dear.&nbsp; Go to your
hills&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From whence,&rdquo; broke in the Reverend Absalom, his
voice changing, &ldquo;cometh help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So away he went in the early morning, knapsack well filled,
blankets rolled, and a megaphone dangling from each side of his
excellent horse.</p>
<p>Yes, he was glad to leave domesticity and <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>towns
behind him; glad to be away from the sound of voices and from the
need of proprieties.&nbsp; He was a hill man, after all, he told
himself, and lifting his face to the sky he thanked God that he
was.&nbsp; They satisfied him, these ancient mountains which once
had been lofty peaks and which through all the changing centuries
had crumbled and shrunken till they were the friendly little
mountains that he knew.&nbsp; They were so old&mdash;so old and
so full of secrets.&nbsp; And they satisfied his restless,
longing, laughing, dreaming soul, the curious soul of Absalom
Summers, which differed from all the other souls on earth.&nbsp;
Yes, he mused, each soul must differ from another, as the stars
in heaven differ.</p>
<p>On he rode through the long day, thinking, dreaming, living a
deep and silent life.&nbsp; At night he made his meal, fed his
horse, smoked his pipe and thought of his sermon.&nbsp; The stars
rolled over him in their silent and majestic courses, and beneath
them he knelt to pray for his wife and babe, those inestimably
dear treasures of his, those lovely creatures of the
hearth-side.&nbsp; They liked their roof; he liked his sky.&nbsp;
Well, blessings on them, and might he be forgiven if he harbored
too wild a nature in his <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>bosom!&nbsp; It was not a silent
prayer that the Reverend Absalom put up.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp;
He shouted to the whispering pines; he addressed the distant
stars; he felt as if he must send his voice beyond the barriers
of silence and reach his God.&nbsp; For that was the kind of man
the Reverend Absalom was.</p>
<p>Then, as trusting as a child in his mother&rsquo;s arms, he
laid him down to sleep.&nbsp; For he felt the &ldquo;Everlasting
Arms&rdquo; about him.</p>
<p>The next morning he arose at sunup and went singing on his
way.&nbsp; He breakfasted at about seven o&rsquo;clock, and
stimulated by his powerful cup of coffee&mdash;which, truth to
tell, was a fearsome liquid&mdash;he pushed onward.&nbsp; The
road he had chosen was difficult to keep and hard to
traverse.&nbsp; There were, of course, easier ways of reaching
Longstreet Mountain, but in order to reach them he would have had
to take a train, and nothing was further from his inclination at
present than riding by steam.&nbsp; He wanted just what he was
having, the heave of good horseflesh beneath him.</p>
<p>The day passed without events other than the sort he desired:
the lift of a bird from a bush, the rippling of a stream across
his path, the <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>nosing of the horse at the ford, a burst of laurel
blossoms in a sunny path.&nbsp; He went on, whistling and
singing.&nbsp; Oftenest it was his old, best-loved hymn: &ldquo;A
mighty fortress is our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along late in the afternoon a mist began to gather over the
mountain.&nbsp; It blurred everything delicately; it put a soft,
filmy veil over the face of the landscape and enhanced its beauty
by so doing.&nbsp; But after a while it began to be a bit
eerie.&nbsp; As the wanderer cooked his evening meal it seemed as
if shadowy white figures drew near, bending over him, and then
flitting away as he arose.&nbsp; It did no more than amuse him,
of course.&nbsp; He knew the tricks of the mountain mist.&nbsp;
But he couldn&rsquo;t help remembering how terrified he had been
once as a child when he had been out on a night much like this,
and had had a five mile walk alone with a lantern in his hand,
which seemed to summon ghostly figures from the roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a bad night for a man with a bad
conscience,&rdquo; he said aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would think
there were avenging spirits on his track, sure enough.&nbsp; Come
to think of it, I&rsquo;ve plenty of things to have a bad
conscience about myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d better be watching out
or the goblins will <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>get me.&nbsp; And whatever would
wife Barbara and baby Jonathan do then, poor things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place where he had lighted his camp fire was in a little
hollow and the mist gathered very thickly there, so he concluded
that it would be better to go on farther up the mountain.&nbsp;
It was possible that he might find an airier place where the
draft would keep the heavier clouds away.&nbsp; So once more he
put his horse to the path and went on silently, rather weary, and
heartily wishing that the night were fair.</p>
<p>He was very far from the beaten road, in a place so solitary
that he could not hope to meet anyone, so it was with no little
surprise that he found himself, suddenly, almost upon a group of
human beings.&nbsp; They were sitting, three of them, around a
fire, well wrapped from the chill.&nbsp; There was a sort of rude
hut beside them, fashioned of saplings and thatched with pine
boughs.&nbsp; Here, apparently, they slept.&nbsp; They were not
then like himself, wanderers, but campers.&nbsp; Well, it was a
quiet place for a camp, and no doubt a sightly one&mdash;</p>
<p>His thoughts broke off like a thread that is snapped.&nbsp; He
recognized the persons at whom he was looking.&nbsp; They were
the Disbrows!&nbsp; They <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>were the fugitives.&nbsp; At first
he thought of going right up to them, but something withheld
him.&nbsp; He could hear Mrs. Disbrow&rsquo;s voice, and he slid
from his horse and having tied him, crept nearer with as much
stealth and skill in silence as an Indian, that he might
listen.&nbsp; There were things he felt that he must know, and
that as Sam&rsquo;s friend he had a right to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to go on, pa,&rdquo; Mrs. Disbrow
was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of going on?&nbsp;
Whatever would it mean for me but another house to look after,
and me lacking the strength to do it?&nbsp; Hannah would drudge
and drudge, and that&rsquo;s all there&rsquo;d be to it.&nbsp;
Living like this there aren&rsquo;t any pantry shelves to clean
or doorsteps to scrub.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a great point to a
woman with no elbow grease.&nbsp; You understand, pa, it&rsquo;s
been pretty dull for me these last few years back.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t tell what it is to lie awake all night wondering if
the morning will ever come, and when the morning comes, hating it
because the light tears your eyes out and the noise splits your
ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you seem to stand the light and the noise here well
enough, ma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I want to stay.&nbsp;
The <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>only
noise is what the crickets and birds make, with now and then a
bee humming or an owl screeching.&nbsp; And the light is green,
coming through the trees.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s as if a thousand
years had rolled off my back.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no one around
wondering about me, and trying this trick and that to get a sight
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one ever did that, ma,&rdquo; cried out the shrill
voice of Hannah.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was just your
imagination.&nbsp; It was your being sick made you think that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, however that may be, out here we&rsquo;re
free.&nbsp; Now I propose, since you&rsquo;ve got some money, pa,
that we move around here and there, like a nice family of
bears&mdash;the father, and the mother and the baby
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a curious, unaccustomed laugh.&nbsp; Then suddenly
she turned toward her husband, and Mr. Summers could see her wild
eyes gleaming in the firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I can&rsquo;t make out, Hector,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;is where you got that money.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t
you talk out the way a husband should to a wife?&nbsp; Here
we&rsquo;ve been living so close to the wind that we hadn&rsquo;t
enough to satisfy us, and Hannah&rsquo;s been going without
enough to clothe <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>her decently.&nbsp; Now, of a sudden, your pockets are
full of money!&nbsp; What does it mean, Hector?&nbsp; And why did
you clear out of Lee in the night?&nbsp; When you gave the word
to go I was feeling so dull in my head that I didn&rsquo;t care
whether the thing was right or wrong.&nbsp; But now I seem to
have come to life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to thinking again, like I
was a real human being.&nbsp; And Hector&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice carried on the air with the wild note of a loon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hector!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma, go on, for goodness sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it come that you got that money just when
Simeon Pace&rsquo;s money disappeared?&nbsp; Tell me that,
husband!&nbsp; Tell me you didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with
it!&nbsp; My life&rsquo;s been queer and dark, but it&rsquo;s
been honest.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve turned out a different man from
what I thought you&rsquo;d be.&nbsp; I hoped on and on for you,
but you didn&rsquo;t get anywhere, and I got worn out and took to
my bed and meant never to get out of it.&nbsp; But even when
you&rsquo;d taken all the spunk out of me I never thought you was
anything but honest.&nbsp; Are you, Hector?&nbsp; Are you
honest&mdash;or a thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wrung Summers&rsquo; heart; yet he knew that the time had
come for judgment.&nbsp; He had been <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>a boy of wild pranks and he loved a
prank still.&nbsp; An idea came flashing into his head.&nbsp; He
crept back to his horse, loosened one of the megaphones and put
it to his mouth, and in that voice which had electrified great
camp meetings, magnified many times by the horn, he bellowed into
the mist:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disbrow, thief!&nbsp; Give back the money you
stole!&nbsp; Make restitution!&nbsp; Return the money of the
orphan!&nbsp; Simeon Pace is in his grave, and his orphan&rsquo;s
money is in your pocket!&nbsp; Disbrow, thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great megaphone waved up and down in the air, and the
accusing voice was borne to the group around the fire, as if
carried on winds from the furthermost heaven.&nbsp; In the white
gloom, with the wreathing wraiths of the mist dancing about them,
the dark cavern below, the sighing trees above, the monstrous
voice, like that of an angry angel, besieged their ears.&nbsp;
Summers was too far from them to see them cower, and he could not
see their stricken faces.&nbsp; His heart secretly misgave him
for what he might be doing to the woman and the girl, but he did
not flinch for all that.&nbsp; He gave out one last call:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make restitution!&nbsp; To-morrow at sunrise set <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>out upon
your journey.&nbsp; Do not pause till wrong has been made
right.&nbsp; This is the first warning.&nbsp; Beware the
second!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain echoes caught it up and shouted the words back,
while up and down the chasm below the roadway the mist figures
writhed and climbed.&nbsp; Summers mounted his horse and stole
back the way he had come till he reached the bottom of the gulch,
then taking the path on the other side of it, he proceeded on his
way.&nbsp; It was almost dawn when he drew rein, tethered his
horse, and laid him down to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said to his horse, &ldquo;that I
haven&rsquo;t scared those poor women to death.&nbsp; But it had
to be, you see&mdash;nothing else for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
suddenly he burst into a wild torrent of laughter.&nbsp; It
rolled out of him in waves; it shook him like a convulsion.&nbsp;
And having eased his soul, he lay down and slept.</p>

261</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GOOD FOR EVIL</span></h2>
<p>The Carsons and the Paces, with Azalea, came driving home one
chilly evening in a light fall of rain.&nbsp; They were tired and
cold and had altogether an after-the-picnic sort of
feeling.&nbsp; Indeed, when Azalea, who was to stay in the valley
for the night, and Annie Laurie had helped the aunts into the
house, they found them so travelworn that they insisted that they
should get into bed at once and have their suppers brought to
them.</p>
<p>A few weeks before, Aunt Adnah would have perished rather than
submit to such an indignity, no matter how comfortable she found
it.&nbsp; And Aunt Zillah would not have indulged in such a
luxury with her sister&rsquo;s stern eye upon her.&nbsp; But more
and more Annie Laurie&rsquo;s determined will was having its way
in that household, and when to her command was added
Azalea&rsquo;s importunities, the aunts yielded.</p>
<p>Sam had the fires burning for them in a few <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>minutes,
and as the old ladies undressed and toasted their shins before
the blaze, and thought of the two competent young girls down in
the kitchen who were preparing supper for them, they experienced
the luxurious feeling of those who are old, well-loved, and
carefully looked after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were girls who would be getting everything out
of its place,&rdquo; said Miss Zillah to Miss Adnah, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;d feel as comfortable as we do; but
they take hold just as we would ourselves.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m bound
to say that I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to stand on my feet to get
supper to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here Annie Laurie has filled those new fangled
water bottles for us, and looked out our warmest
nightgowns.&nbsp; We certainly have a lot to be thankful for,
Zillah.&nbsp; When brother passed away I thought that I would
just naturally step in and take charge of things&mdash;I believed
I had the strength for it and the brains for it,&mdash;but it
seems it was not to be.&nbsp; Whether it was the shock of
Simeon&rsquo;s death or merely that I&rsquo;m getting old, I
wouldn&rsquo;t undertake to say, but certainly I&rsquo;m not the
woman I was.&nbsp; Why, suddenly when I think to be the
strongest, I find myself <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>all shaky in the knees and confused
in the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the nervous shock, sister.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be all right by and by.&nbsp; Trouble is like
sickness, it takes a while to recuperate from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door and Annie Laurie entered bearing
a tray.&nbsp; Behind her was Azalea with another.&nbsp; Tea,
toast, little golden omelettes, preserves and other dainties
tempting to the appetites of two jaded old ladies appeared on the
best dishes and the whitest napery that could be found in the
Pace household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, my, what a fuss you make over us,&rdquo; said Aunt
Adnah, disapprovingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the common
dishes would have done perfectly well, Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie shook her finger at her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call me Ann,&rdquo; she laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The best dishes are none too good for you two; and anyway,
we&rsquo;re celebrating because we&rsquo;re home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Zillah narrowed her eyes in a way she had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you love your home, child, now that
there are only us two old souls in it, and that we&rsquo;re so
poor and all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I love my home,&rdquo; declared Annie
Laurie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should say I did!&nbsp; And we&rsquo;re
not <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>going to be poor.&nbsp; I simply won&rsquo;t be
poor.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t feel poor anyway.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
so meachin to feel poor!&nbsp; Please don&rsquo;t use the word,
Aunt.&nbsp; How can you, when we have a fire like this and
suppers as good as those on the trays, and when we can ask a
friend in whenever we please, and go on lovely vacations?&nbsp;
Poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little shiver of disgust at the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure you do put heart into one,&rdquo;
sighed Aunt Zillah, as if she needed all the good cheer that
anybody could spare her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes I do think
we&rsquo;re falling off in our spirits, Adnah and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls stood laughing and talking with the aunts a few
minutes more, and then ran down to get their own suppers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat it before the living room fire,&rdquo;
said Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put it on the sewing
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll have Sam to eat with us.&nbsp; He
simply must, that&rsquo;s all, we&rsquo;ve so much to tell
him,&rdquo; added Annie Laurie.</p>
<p>It was a much easier thing for Azalea to cook the supper than
it was for Annie Laurie to persuade Sam to come in and eat with
them.&nbsp; But the bright-faced girl, with her good will shining
in her face, succeeded in overcoming his <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>scruples.&nbsp; It was very hard for so social a
creature as Sam to keep to himself, holding before himself the
hard fact:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the son of a man who is under suspicion.&nbsp; I
must not be the friend of honest folk until I am proved of an
honest family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-night, at any rate, he permitted himself to forget.&nbsp;
So, while the rain dashed against the windowpane, the three sat,
warm and dry, in the familiar room and ate their supper, while
the girls told stories of the curious people they had seen, and
of the nice and interesting ones, and of dangers from which they
had thrillingly escaped.</p>
<p>In the midst of it there came a knock at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearest.&nbsp; Who can it be on such a
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung wide the door, and then as the other two turned to
see who it was, she half closed it again, involuntarily, and
stepped back.&nbsp; Something was the matter, Sam perceived as he
started to his feet; then he saw Annie Laurie fling open the door
again and back away from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said in a strange voice.</p>
<p>And a man entered with a curiously swift <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>movement,
almost as if he were hunted.&nbsp; The rain ran from his clothes
and his beard; he was covered with red clay, and he seemed to
shrink from observation.&nbsp; Yet after a second he took off his
hat, and then Sam saw that it was his father.&nbsp; Mr. Disbrow
came into the room at last and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Sam breathed, but Annie Laurie held up
her hand and Sam said no more.&nbsp; She seemed for the moment to
be carried out of herself, and to cease to be a very young and
inexperienced girl, and to take on the grave look of one who was
sitting in judgment.</p>
<p>Disbrow&rsquo;s eyes, usually so wavering, fixed themselves on
Annie Laurie&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They were quite on a level, these
two, as to height, but the man looked broken and beaten; the girl
was strong and free and, in her simple way, proud.&nbsp; She
stood there waiting, and Disbrow came on toward her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

"&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said in a strange voice"

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to make it up to you, miss,&rdquo; he
said with trembling lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to give
back what I took from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above the crackling of the fire and the beating of the rain on
the windows they heard her say:</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>&ldquo;I am glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man tore off his dripping coat, and taking a knife from
his pocket, began cutting at the lining.&nbsp; He took out
package after package of bills and laid them on the table.&nbsp;
And still he clipped, and still the money appeared from the
wadded lining of the coat.&nbsp; Then he flung the coat on a
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it there,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If there is more you can find it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He folded
his arms and looked at the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
tried to go on with the plan I&rsquo;d laid out for myself, but I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep for thinking I was a thief.&nbsp; And then a
voice came from Heaven and told me so.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t smile at
that, miss&mdash;my poor wife heard the voice, and Hannah heard
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve left them out in the mountains and God only
knows what will come to them, for I reckon you&rsquo;ll be
wanting to hand me over to the sheriff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Disbrow,&rdquo; cried Annie Laurie, &ldquo;you
know I&rsquo;ll not do anything of the kind.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t do such a thing to an old neighbor, and to
Sam&rsquo;s father at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disbrow raised one arm in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a clean breast of everything
now,&rdquo; <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>he said in his deep quavering voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sam
ain&rsquo;t my boy; nor he ain&rsquo;t my wife&rsquo;s boy.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s taken from the asylum, Sam is.&nbsp; We thought we
wasn&rsquo;t going to have a child, and we took him and never
told him.&nbsp; Anybody could see he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t our boy,
if they&rsquo;d had sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie half turned.&nbsp; There was a consuming pity in
her heart, and a great hope that Sam would not disappoint
her.&nbsp; And he did not.&nbsp; He took three strides and stood
by the man he had all his life called father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we won&rsquo;t go back on the
relationship,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you took me out of
an asylum and cared for me when I was little, I don&rsquo;t mean
to go back on you just now, sir, when you&rsquo;re&mdash;when
you&rsquo;re down on your luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not down on his luck,&rdquo; said Annie
Laurie in her clear tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lucky man to
have the courage to bring back the thing he took that
wasn&rsquo;t his, Sam.&nbsp; Not everyone could have done
it.&nbsp; You ought to feel proud of a father who could do that,
Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Sam.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty
proud of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their youth, and the generosity of their youth, their desire
to do the best they could for each <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>other&rsquo;s sake, had winged them
up to that high place where Mercy sits.&nbsp; Azalea, watching
them, thrilled to think they were her friends.&nbsp; They were
doing precisely what Ma McBirney would have wished them to do if
she had been there to advise them.&nbsp; They were not being
just&mdash;they were much, much better than just.&nbsp; They were
merciful.&nbsp; Annie Laurie went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much money there is there,
sir,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the pile of bills on the table,
&ldquo;but I am sure there is a good deal and that you have given
me back all you took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but two hundred dollars, miss.&nbsp; I gave Sam a
hundred, and I used a hundred myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pay it
back some day, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I was going to say was that I want you to count
out a thousand dollars of that money for yourself.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not going to lend it to you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
you to go on thinking you have a debt like that.&nbsp; I know
you&rsquo;ve had a hard time, Mr. Disbrow.&nbsp; Father used to
speak of it and feel sorry; and I&rsquo;ve felt dreadfully sorry
for you times and times.&nbsp; Now, you&rsquo;re to take a
thousand and just pretend, if you like, that my father willed it
to you, and then you&rsquo;re to go <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>away where you can begin over with a
little shop, or farm, and make your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pretend that Simeon Pace had willed it to him&mdash;Simeon
Pace whom he had hated because Pace was a successful man and he
an unsuccessful one!&nbsp; And Pace had felt sorry for him!&nbsp;
But if that was the case, why hadn&rsquo;t he helped him?&nbsp;
Yet Hector Disbrow knew why&mdash;he knew it was because of his
lazy ways and his bitter tongue, and for the first time in his
life he saw himself as his neighbors had seen him, as a hang-dog
man whom it was anything but pleasant to meet.&nbsp; Yes, he had
missed the road, someway.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t known how to find
the House of Good Will.&nbsp; He had broken his wife&rsquo;s
spirit, and had darkened the lives of the two children who lived
beneath his roof.&nbsp; He had made a failure of
everything&mdash;had even sunk to be a thief.&nbsp; And now here
was this girl giving him another chance.&nbsp; And Sam was saying
that he&rsquo;d still be his son!</p>
<p>He was cold and hungry, worn with sleeplessness, shaken with
the memory of the terrible voice that had cried in the mist, and
this unexpected kindness was too much for him.&nbsp; He had not
meant to do it&mdash;did not know that he ever <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>could do
such a thing&mdash;but he burst into the sobs of a broken man,
and when Sam had led him to a chair he dropped his head on the
table and wept.</p>
<p>They talked together, the four of them, when Mr. Disbrow had
grown calmer.&nbsp; Azalea would have left them, but Annie Laurie
wanted her to stay.&nbsp; She held her hand and kept her close
beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand everything, Azalea,&rdquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem surprised at good
times or at bad times, dear.&nbsp; You take things as they
come.&nbsp; Stay with me, Azalea, I need you very
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do, miss?&rdquo; Disbrow had asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you let the people know how you got your money
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie thought a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think they have been suspecting you,
Mr. Disbrow?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The man nodded miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a man in town would shake
hands with me,&rdquo; he confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; went on the girl,
&ldquo;that they thought it fine of Sam to give up his school <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>and to come
back here and help out the aunts and myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have thought he was trying to give a square
deal,&rdquo; said Disbrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Annie Laurie went on, holding tight
to Azalea&rsquo;s hand to gather courage, &ldquo;I think I ought
to tell them.&nbsp; It will let them know you were honest in your
heart after all, and it will make them give Sam credit for what
he&rsquo;s done.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the right way,
Mr. Disbrow.&nbsp; When I was naughty I used to like to be
punished&mdash;it made me feel fair and honest again.&nbsp; And
you&rsquo;ll feel better if the neighbors know.&nbsp; That will
be your punishment.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s more, it will explain
everything.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to have to tell a lie when I
say how I got my money back.&nbsp; I never yet told a lie and I
don&rsquo;t want to begin now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bowed his head and sat staring into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon what you say is right,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>Azalea had placed a heaping plate of food before him.&nbsp;
She made hot coffee and urged him to drink it.&nbsp; And she
found a pouch of tobacco and forced that on him.&nbsp; His
clothes had dried <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>before the hearty fire, and when he had lighted his
pipe he began to feel master of himself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, dad,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;that the best
thing for you to do is to get out of here to-night before
you&rsquo;re seen.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve some heavy new boots that you
can wear and you can have my raincoat and sou&rsquo;wester.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s my advice&mdash;hit the trail to-night and get so
far out of the way that none of your old neighbors will meet
you.&nbsp; Settle in some live town over the mountain; put mother
in a nice, light, little house&mdash;and whatever you do,
don&rsquo;t have green shades to the windows&mdash;and maybe
she&rsquo;ll get well again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s better now,&rdquo; said Mr. Disbrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fifty percent better.&nbsp; But of course she looks with
contempt on me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether she&rsquo;ll let
me go back to her or not, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Sam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course she
will!&nbsp; You go back and don&rsquo;t take no for an
answer.&nbsp; You-all just hike over the mountain to a new place
and get a new start all &rsquo;round.&nbsp; And one of the first
things is to get Hannah&rsquo;s eyes straightened.&nbsp; She
can&rsquo;t enjoy herself the way she is.&nbsp; It just spoils
her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does, Mr. Disbrow,&rdquo; put in Azalea.&nbsp;
<a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>&ldquo;It makes her so shy that it&rsquo;s terrible for
her.&nbsp; Do say you&rsquo;ll have her eyes made
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disbrow looked up at Azalea with something almost like a
smile.&nbsp; She was bending forward pleading with him, her own
odd, intense look on her face.&nbsp; She did indeed seem to have
a way of understanding the troubles of people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll tell Hannah you-all told me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a few minutes, then Mr. Disbrow turned
his eyes on Sam and a deep flush spread over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right for you to say you&rsquo;ll stand
by me, son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if I go sneakin&rsquo; off
and hidin&rsquo; away, how am I going to be able to stand by
you?&nbsp; What will &rsquo;come of you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t worry about me, sir,&rdquo; Sam said
independently; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get on somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s going to be easy for Sam,&rdquo; Annie
Laurie broke in enthusiastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s
this way.&nbsp; Now I have my money I&rsquo;ll be able to pay for
all the work he&rsquo;s been doing for me, and he&rsquo;ll keep
right on working and saving up his money, and next October
he&rsquo;ll go back to the Rutherford Academy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
not so far away but that he can afford to run down here every
week <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>or
two to go over the books, and he&rsquo;ll get some good man in to
take his place while he&rsquo;s away.&nbsp; Vacations, he can
take charge himself.&nbsp; Oh, we&rsquo;ll get on now, Mr.
Disbrow, both Sam and I, and we&rsquo;ll have plenty of schooling
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hector Disbrow looked at the tall boy sitting beside him and
at the bright-faced girl who had spoken, and started to say
something, but thought better of it and put his hand up to his
mouth instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he heard Azalea murmur.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get on now.&nbsp; Things are coming all
right for them just as they have for me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an
end to trouble, isn&rsquo;t there, if you just hang on and
wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is, miss,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Disbrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now I reckon I better take the advice you all gave me
and hike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to walk, sir?&rdquo; Sam asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve got one of the horses hid back here a
ways.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll slip on him and get up the mountain before
daybreak.&nbsp; Your ma and Hannah will be worrying about me, I
reckon.&nbsp; Ma&rsquo;s down on me, but that won&rsquo;t keep
her from worrying about me, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam nodded.</p>
<p><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sleeping in a little tent I rigged
up for them&mdash;kind of half house, half tent.&nbsp; Durn it, I
wish I could buy something to take to &rsquo;em.&nbsp; The food
supply&rsquo;s getting mighty low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you saddle bags on your horse, Mr. Disbrow?&rdquo;
Annie Laurie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said Disbrow dryly, ashamed to test
her generosity further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then drive up to the storehouse door and we&rsquo;ll be
out with a lantern.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve enough food to feed a little
army and you-all mustn&rsquo;t go hungry while that&rsquo;s the
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He avoided her look as he thanked her.&nbsp; Was she going to
remember her offer to him of a thousand dollars?&nbsp; She surely
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;count out the money I
promised Mr. Disbrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea turned to the table where the fascinating rolls
lay.&nbsp; There was indeed, much of it.&nbsp; Most of the bills
were of the hundred dollar denomination.&nbsp; None of the
children had seen anything like it&mdash;it was like looking into
Aladdin&rsquo;s cave to stand there beside that old table with
rolls of bank notes.&nbsp; Perhaps each one of the young persons
wished that it had been in gold instead of paper money, but even
as it was <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>it thrilled them.&nbsp; Azalea&rsquo;s fingers
trembled, as slowly and accurately she counted out the ten one
hundred-dollar bills and handed them to Annie Laurie, who in turn
gave them to Mr. Disbrow.&nbsp; He would have liked, in the
shamed soul of him, to make some sort of a joke of it, but he
could not and the cheap words he tried to speak died on his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because you brought back my
money,&rdquo; Annie Laurie added, with something of the stern
accent of her Aunt Adnah; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re
an old neighbor, as I said, and because I&rsquo;ve known you ever
since I was a little girl and I have seen that things were hard
for you.&nbsp; Most of all, it&rsquo;s because Sam would like me
to do it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s so, isn&rsquo;t it, Sam; you like me
to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Annie Laurie,&rdquo; Sam cried, choking, &ldquo;I
like you to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted the old coat from the chair and helped his father
into it, but it was soaking wet and he flung it down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back with
the dry things in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So in the new, dry boots, a reefer, raincoat and <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>storm
hat&mdash;fed, warmed, forgiven, the man who had so failed went
out from Annie Laurie&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be waiting at the storehouse for
you,&rdquo; she called after him.&nbsp; And half an hour later,
with his saddle bags well filled, he was off up the mountain,
never to come into their lives again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back by the fire,&rdquo; pleaded Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, Sam, come back and get warm before you go to
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it can be so chilly again after
all the lovely days we&rsquo;ve had,&rdquo; Annie Laurie
remarked.&nbsp; She was deeply moved and glad of the opportunity
to talk about something besides the man who had just ridden away
from them.</p>
<p>So the three went in and sat before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam,&rdquo; said Azalea, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t
ask Mr. Disbrow who your father really was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he knew,&rdquo; Sam said,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not sure I want to.&rdquo;&nbsp; He dropped
his head in his hands and sat staring at the dying fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Annie Laurie said,
&ldquo;America&rsquo;s for individuals.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
Mr. Summers says and that&rsquo;s what I think too.&nbsp; And as
an individual, Sam, you&rsquo;ll pass muster, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam laughed rather bitterly.</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he half groaned, &ldquo;I
wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; I was just thinking
what a queer, lonely trio we are&mdash;orphans, the three of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girls, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat for a time in silence, each absorbed in
thought.&nbsp; The fire crackled a little now and then, and sank
lower and lower.&nbsp; By and by Annie Laurie spoke
softly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re orphans, but I
reckon we&rsquo;ll be taken care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; murmured Azalea&rsquo;s soft
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&nbsp; Why Ma
McBirney&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of us have no Ma McBirney,&rdquo; Sam reminded
her.</p>
<p>But after all, though they were pensive, they were not
unhappy.&nbsp; The feeling that they were close and trusted
friends comforted them.&nbsp; High adventure seemed to be before
them.&nbsp; The fortune, so curiously lost and so strangely
regained lay there on the table by them.&nbsp; Sam and Azalea
wondered that Annie Laurie did not count it to find out how much
it was, but she seemed oddly indifferent to that fact.&nbsp; Only
<a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>after a
time she arose, brushed the bills into her apron and stood for a
moment smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she said shyly, &ldquo;creep up to the
attic, softly, so as not to disturb the aunts, and bring me down
dad&rsquo;s old tin arm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Sam, horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; begged the girl.</p>
<p>So Sam brought it and the three laid the rolls of bills neatly
within it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will comfort father,&rdquo; said Annie Laurie
quaintly, &ldquo;but to-morrow I&rsquo;m going to put it in the
bank.&rdquo;</p>

281</span>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AZALEA&rsquo;S PARTY</span></h2>
<p>Baby Jonathan had just been stung by one of Pa
McBirney&rsquo;s bees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way he kisseth,&rdquo; he
screamed, standing beside the clump of golden glow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not, indeed, mamma&rsquo;s own
honey-bird,&rdquo; soothed Mrs. Barbara, dashing for him and
gathering him into her arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;He thought you were a
flower, son-son, and just lighted on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kisseth too hard,&rdquo; sobbed Jonathan, plunging
his golden head into the hollow of his mother&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to play with him any more,
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a shame that he should be stung at his first
party,&rdquo; said his mother indignantly, as she carried him to
the seat at the McBirney outlook where she had been sitting with
young Richard Heller, Sam Disbrow&rsquo;s friend&mdash;the one
who had spoken the cruel-kind words of truth to him <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>which had
sent him away from the Rutherford Academy without so much as
putting his name on the register.&nbsp; They had been talking
about Sam now, and when Mrs. Summers had plastered clay over the
wounded cheek of her son, and had soothed him with many kisses,
they resumed their conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to come all right with him next
term,&rdquo; Dick said to Mrs. Summers.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the
fellows in the country who know him at all realize what a brick
he&rsquo;s been, staying right here and looking his trouble in
the face and helping the Paces out the way he did.&nbsp; Why,
some of the men wanted him to change his name when it turned out
that Disbrow was such a thief, but he wouldn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp;
He said he&rsquo;d promised his dad&mdash;he will call him
that&mdash;to stick to him, and that it wouldn&rsquo;t be keeping
his word to take another name.&nbsp; He said Disbrow was as good
a name as any if he <i>made</i> it good.&nbsp; So he&rsquo;ll be
given a hearty reception when he comes back to Rutherford.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve frozen onto the room next to mine there at the
Ballenger dormitories and I&rsquo;m going to get the prefect to
put him in there.&nbsp; The fellows shall see that he and I are
friends, anyway.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as that counts for such
a <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>tremendous lot, but I&rsquo;ll let it stand for all it
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Summers, turning her bright
smile on the lad.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what it
means to me that my Sam is going to be happy.&nbsp; As you know,
he&rsquo;s been living with us the past few months, and never,
never did I see a boy who tried harder to do what was
right.&nbsp; But, dear me, that isn&rsquo;t all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
known good folk who almost wore me out.&nbsp; But Sam is
charming.&nbsp; Now that he&rsquo;s happy once more he&rsquo;s
the very life of the place, and that&rsquo;s saying a good deal
of a house where my husband lives.&nbsp; Besides, Jonathan rather
keeps things going.&nbsp; Altogether, I suppose we&rsquo;re the
noisiest and the happiest lot in Lee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are,&rdquo; smiled the youth
admiringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know Sam&rsquo;s a wonder at keeping
things humming.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been like that from the time he
was a little boy, and I never could make out how such a live one
could belong to a sour, down-in-the-mouth family like the
Disbrows.&nbsp; It was quite a relief to me when I found he
wasn&rsquo;t really related to them after all, but had just been
dropped in the nest, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a relief to everyone who cared for <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>him, I
imagine,&rdquo; Mrs. Summers said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But am I not
keeping you here, Dick, away from the young people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stay here if I didn&rsquo;t want to,
Mrs. Summers,&rdquo; Dick replied gallantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see
I don&rsquo;t know these girls very well, but Sam wanted me to
come up with him, and Azalea was good enough to say she&rsquo;d
love to have me, so of course I came.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve often
ridden by the McBirneys and thought what a delightful little
place it was, but I didn&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d ever be coming
to a birthday party here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, naturally you wouldn&rsquo;t have supposed
it.&nbsp; There are you in your fine, handsome home, the
banker&rsquo;s son, all of your paths running in a different
direction from those of the McBirneys, yet I doubt if ever in
your life you visited a house where there was more real courtesy
and hospitality than there is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure of that, Mrs. Summers.&nbsp; And
then Azalea&mdash;isn&rsquo;t she a wonder?&nbsp; She fascinates
everybody.&nbsp; As my mother was saying this morning, if ever
there was a girl who would make you forget all about social
distinction and just join in on a happy human basis to have a
good time&mdash;all hands &rsquo;round&mdash;that person is <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>Azalea.&nbsp; Of course, as mother reminded me, Azalea
came from as cultivated a family as ever lived in this district,
although she is now to all intents the daughter of these mountain
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a privilege,&rdquo; said Barbara Summers,
&ldquo;to live with Mrs. McBirney, and anyone who has the sense
to get the most out of it will grow up to be good and patient and
wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps these virtues were not the ones which most appealed to
Dick Heller at that period of his life, but however that may be,
he could not keep his eyes off the mountain girl.&nbsp; He could
see her in her white, hand-wrought frock, her hair blown about
her dark face, flashing here and there with her friends.&nbsp; He
saw her run to serve some one who was merely driving along the
road&mdash;for the road over Tennyson Mountain to Lee ran quite
through the McBirney yard, as has been said before.&nbsp; It was
evident that the McBirney&rsquo;s were asking everyone who passed
to congratulate them on their adopted daughter&rsquo;s fifteenth
birthday, and in return they were served with the drink of
sweetened limes and the honey cake which Ma McBirney had prepared
for the occasion.</p>
<p>And there was Pa McBirney in his white <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>linen
clothes&mdash;they had been his father&rsquo;s&mdash;talking with
Mr. Carson, in his smart white flannels; and Miss Adnah and Miss
Zillah in new figured lawns, carrying their old fringed parasols
bought years before on a great occasion at Charleston; and near
them was Mrs. Kitchell with the younger children, brown and
strong, and quite in the spirit of the occasion; and Hi and Jim
were putting boards on saw horses, ready for the feast; and Carin
and Annie Laurie were running down the road to welcome some
freshly arrived guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; boomed the great voice of the Reverend
Absalom Summers, &ldquo;there never was another spot like this
one!&nbsp; Now, was there ever, anywhere?&nbsp; When I get up
here I feel just like a boy, I&rsquo;m so happy&mdash;why,
I&rsquo;m just silly with happiness.&nbsp; I like the way the
grass smells, and the road winds, and the spring gushes, and the
flowers blossom, and the clouds sail, and the valley lies, and
Mrs. McBirney cooks, and Mr. McBirney tells stories, and Jim
whistles, and I&rsquo;ll be plagued if I don&rsquo;t like
everything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be calm, Absalom dear,&rdquo; smiled his <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to hoot like an owl because
you&rsquo;re happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how to stop the hooting of an owl?&rdquo;
demanded the irrepressible man of the company in general.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You just stand it as long as you can without swearing and
then you take off your right slipper and put it on your left foot
and the owl will stop.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried it dozens of
times&mdash;and the owl always stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git along!&rdquo; called a voice from somewhere up
among the trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;That way don&rsquo;t compare with
my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that challenging me?&rdquo; roared Mr.
Summers.&nbsp; But he had no need to ask.&nbsp; It was Haystack
Thompson who was dropping down on them from somewhere up in the
mountain, and who of course had his fiddle under his arm.&nbsp;
For to go to a party without a fiddle was something of which Mr.
Thompson never yet had been guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your receipt for stopping a hootin&rsquo;
owl, Mr. Bones?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Summers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered Haystack seriously, &ldquo;you
jest heat a poker white hot and wave it in the air three times
and they&rsquo;ll stop clean off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absalom Summers shook his great fist under <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>Haystack&rsquo;s nose&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use
in trying to force a fool superstition like that down our
throats, Thompson?&rdquo; he roared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Changing
slippers is the only up-to-date, scientific way and Heller here,
who&rsquo;s been to school, can tell you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Haystack refused to yield an inch.&nbsp; A heated poker
was the thing for him, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fiddle&rsquo;s the thing for you, Mr.
Thompson,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe you know how to handle anything else&mdash;not even a
porridge spoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, unconsciously, the old man had been taking the
covering from the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Thomas
McBirney said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tune up, old friend.&nbsp; Then
we&rsquo;ll know that it&rsquo;s a party for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And tune up he did.&nbsp; At first it seemed only to be
tuning, and they couldn&rsquo;t tell where he left off getting
ready and when he began to play.&nbsp; But by and by there were
odd little sounds that might have been squirrels chittering, or
birds stirring in their nests.&nbsp; Then they grew sweeter and
more liquid and seemed like water running over stones and wind
singing in the trees.&nbsp; And by and by the whistle of a robin
<a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>broke in
and then a thrush sang his soul out at the gates of Heaven; then
the night seemed to be falling, kindly, as if it would give rest
to all the weary.&nbsp; After that it was black for a moment or
two, as if a storm was gathering.&nbsp; There seemed to be
distant sounds of thunder.&nbsp; But it passed quickly as some
nights do, if one is, for example, fifteen, and then the dawn
came over the hills, dancing.&nbsp; There must have been blithe
maidens ushering it in&mdash;for who else would have had such
light and lilting feet?&nbsp; Yes, they were dancing down over
the hills, scattering flowers, and the birds were perched upon
their shoulders and rosy clouds were wreathing them.</p>
<p>At least that was the lovely picture that Haystack
Thompson&rsquo;s music brought to Barbara Summers as she sat
holding her little son, and then the next thing she knew all of
her friends really were dancing.&nbsp; Ma McBirney was dancing
with Mr. Carson, and Pa McBirney had Annie Laurie for a partner,
and Sam had Azalea, and Carin was with Dick Heller, and Jim was
footing it with Hi&rsquo;s little sister, and Hi and his mother
were making a show of hopping around.</p>
<p>Only Absalom Summers wasn&rsquo;t dancing, <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>because he
was the Methodist minister and didn&rsquo;t believe in
it&mdash;at least he said he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He sat beating
juba with his great hands, making a terrific rhythmical
accompaniment and crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;keep it up&mdash;go right along
on the road to destruction&mdash;keep it up there,
McBirney&mdash;I&rsquo;m here to see you through.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
threw back his head with its tossed straight hair and gave vent
to a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a comfortable preacher to have
around,&rdquo; declared Mr. Carson, stopping to catch his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comfortable!&rdquo; roared Mr. Summers, giving a twist
to Mr. Carson&rsquo;s meaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never was so
comfortable in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Adnah and Miss Zillah were helping Ma McBirney to set the
table now, and the young people were dashing about on errands,
and more friends were coming, some from over the mountains and
some up from town, and by and by they all sat down to the table
and ate together.&nbsp; There was fried chicken, and rice cooked
with cheese, and beaten biscuit, and golden butter in little
pats, and cooling drinks of lime and orange and mint, and
cakes&mdash;three kinds&mdash;and ice cream which the
Carson&rsquo;s had <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>brought up in great freezers.&nbsp; It is necessary to
tell what there was to eat, because eating is a very important
part of a party.</p>
<p>And then there were the gifts to see.&nbsp; Almost everyone
had brought a gift.&nbsp; Even some of the people who were
passing and who had not known there was to be a party at all, and
who perhaps did not know the McBirneys very well, had fished out
something from their wagons for the orphan girl who had made so
many people love her.</p>
<p>So there was the little gold watch from Mrs. Carson, and the
ivory toilet set from Carin, a set of Tennyson from Mr. Carson,
and a handmade petticoat from Annie Laurie, and some old eardrops
of pink coral made into a brooch by Miss Adnah, and a knitted
shoulder shawl from Miss Zillah, and a kind of zither thing that
Sam had made himself, and a box of sweets from Dick Heller,
and&mdash;are you out of breath?&nbsp; Because there are ever so
many more things.&nbsp; There was a rag rug, beautifully woven,
from Mrs. Kitchell, and a whisk broom holder from Hi, and a
wonderful melon-shaped basket, fine and delicate, from Haystack
Thompson, who knew more than most about weaving baskets, and <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>there was a
white parasol from Ma McBirney&mdash;who never could afford a
parasol for herself&mdash;and a new riding whip from Pa McBirney,
and from Jim a new curry comb which he said he would use when he
curried Paprika, the pony.&nbsp; And then other people, about
whom you know nothing, brought their contributions.&nbsp;
Everything was laid out in that pleasant, open chamber, which it
will be remembered divided the McBirney house in two.</p>
<p>The people who came to this party weren&rsquo;t the sort whose
singing is ruined by something good to eat.&nbsp; After the
dishes had been cleared away they sat where they could look off
at the valley as the shadows began to stretch long and purple
down from the ridges.</p>
<p>And then everyone regretfully realized that it was time to go
home.&nbsp; So there was a great mounting of horses and piling
into wagons, and Jim and Hi held stirrups and helped ladies into
the high mountain wagons&mdash;the sort you can turn the wheel
under if you have to make a short curve&mdash;and presently they
were all off and away.</p>
<p>Azalea, all in her pretty white, slipped on Paprika&rsquo;s
back and rode for a way with her guests.&nbsp; But at the first
turn she shouted her <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>good-byes to them and turned back up
the mountain.&nbsp; It was getting to be dusky now even along her
high path, and the coolness of the evening was settling about
her.&nbsp; It was a fragrant dusk, for the summer was at its
height and sent out a thousand pleasant perfumes.&nbsp; She
brought her pony to a halt as she reached the top of the ridge,
and waited for a moment to let herself sink fairly into the place
and the hour.&nbsp; The trees, whispering in her ear, seemed her
close friends; the night was like a protectress; the little
sleeping creatures in the trees and the holes of the ground
seemed close and kind.</p>
<p>For once that eager nature of hers, which asked for so full a
measure of joy and delight, was satisfied.&nbsp; She spoke a word
to her little mare, which began picking out the road again with
her sure feet.&nbsp; As Paprika drew near the house she whinnied,
and Azalea laughingly imitated her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send her along, sis,&rdquo; shouted Jim from somewhere
in the gloom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; called back Azalea.&nbsp; She slipped
from her saddle and ran into the lighted room.&nbsp; Pa McBirney
was smoking, Ma McBirney was still busy putting thing to
rights.&nbsp; Azalea gave <a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>her a gentle push which sent her
into her own deep-armed rocker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter will do the rest,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; protested Mary McBirney,
&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you tired?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been going like
a streak all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t begin before sunup the way you
did, mother.&nbsp; My, my, what a happy day it&rsquo;s
been!&nbsp; What a happy day!&nbsp; And a little more than a year
ago&mdash;&rdquo; she could not go on.</p>
<p>All three were silent, thinking of the changes a year had
brought.&nbsp; Azalea had remembered that morning to trim with
flowers the graves beneath the Pride of India tree, so that they
would, in their way, be included in the festival.&nbsp; For Ma
McBirney had taught her how love can live on though death comes
between, and how sorrow can be turned into sweetness.</p>
<p>That seemed to be the secret of the whole thing
anyway&mdash;turning sorrow into sweetness.</p>
<p>Finally Azalea spoke again.&nbsp; She had just set the best
dishes in their place and folded up the table cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girls,&rdquo; she said musingly,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve come to me too, this year&mdash;Carin and
Annie Laurie.&nbsp; Dear me, but we do have fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Ma McBirney
sympathetically, &ldquo;I never did see three girls have a better
understanding of each other, or ones who enjoyed each
other&rsquo;s society more.&nbsp; What is it Mrs. Carson calls
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Triple Alliance,&rdquo; smiled Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now, since it&rsquo;s all right about Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s money, I really and truly do think we&rsquo;re the
happiest girls in the world.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
